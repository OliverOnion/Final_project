Yet, thanks to advances in DNA analysis, scientists have uncovered intriguing clues about their lives. Read on for nine facts about the mysterious Denisovans.', 'Today, all modern humans are Homo sapiens, but as a species we have taken millennia to evolve. The very earliest human ancestors (a.k.a. hominins) emerged around 7 million years ago, while species in our genus, Homo, began appearing about 2.3 million years ago. Within the last 150 years or so, scientists have discovered evidence for at least eight different hominins in Homo, from Homo erectus, the first to migrate out of Africa, to the tiny Homo floresiensis, who stood only 3 feet, 6 inches tall.', 'In 2010, Russian scientists Michael Shunkov and Anatoly Derevianko unearthed a tiny finger bone in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. The fragment was sent to the Max Planck Institute in Germany for DNA analysis, where a team led by paleogeneticist Svante P\\u00c3\\u00a4\\u00c3\\u00a4bo determined that the bone came from an unknown type of archaic human, closely related to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis.', 'The first bone fragment was found in the Denisova cave, which lent its name to the mysterious hominins. This incredible site is the only place in the world known to have been occupied by more than one hominin group. Fossils and debris from the many layers of cave floor provide evidence that the cave was inhabited by Denisovans roughly 200,000 years ago, by Neanderthals 100,000 years ago, and by modern humans. At some point, the two groups of extinct hominins may have coexisted there.', 'The Denisovans are especially mysterious because archaeologists have uncovered so few fossils, meaning that we don\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really know what they looked like. The only known fossils so far confirmed as Denisovan include three loose teeth, a skull fragment, a finger bone, half of a broken jawbone, and four other small slivers of bone. The remains were identified as Denisovan by protein or DNA analysis rather than morphology, and fascinating questions about the physical characteristics of these ancient human ancestors are still to be answered.', 'Scientists continue to search for more Denisovan bones. Fossils found in China, Taiwan, and Kyrgyzstan are thought to be likely contenders; however, their poor quality have precluded any DNA extraction and analysis. At this stage, it\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unclear if they are Denisovan or belong to another hominin group.', 'The Denisovans are the only hominin identified as distinct from other hominins by DNA alone. Because so few of their fossils have been found\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94and because the ones we have are mere fragments\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94scientists haven\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t determined the anatomy of a Denisovan. Without the physical description, they can\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be confirmed as a new species or subspecies. For now, Denisovans are considered a \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpopulation\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in the genus Homo.', 'Researchers looking at human evolution have suggested that the human ancestor Homo heidelbergensis, which lived between 600,000 and 300,000 years ago, left Africa about 400,000 years ago. Some moved west into Europe and likely evolved into Neanderthals, while others traveled into central Asia and became the Denisovans.', 'Hominin groups that remained in Africa evolved into Homo sapiens. By 60,000 years ago, this group had also migrated into Europe and Asia, and lived alongside Neanderthals and Denisovans for several thousand years.', 'In 2018, analysis of a bone fragment found in Siberia revealed that it came from a teenage girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, providing the only known evidence of a first-generation hybrid hominin. The girl, nicknamed \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDenny,\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was thought to have lived 90,000 years ago. DNA evidence shows that Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans were related closely enough that they could interbreed and bear children, and that Neanderthals and Denisovans were more closely related to each other than to Homo sapiens.', 'The fossilized remains of Denisovans come from just two locations, Siberia and Tibet (though a tooth found in Laos may also be Denisovan). Their genetic legacy, however,  suggests they inhabited large swaths of Asia. DNA analysis of modern humans in Southeast Asia shows that many people have traces of Denisovan DNA, suggesting modern humans in the region interbred with Denisovans many thousands of years ago and indicating that they lived much farther south than had been initially thought.', 'Genetic evidence from Papua New Guinea hints that some modern humans may have interbred with Denisovans as recently as 25,000 years ago, implying that Homo sapiens and Denisovans coexisted in these areas for thousands of years. Today, the Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines, modern New Guineans, and Aboriginal Australians may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their genes to Denisovan DNA.', 'The Denisovans lived harsh environments, from the cold, frozen steppes of Siberia to the high altitudes of Tibet. The excavations in Laos also suggest that some Denisovan communities lived in the lush tropical woodlands of Southeast Asia. The variety of the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 habitats implies that they readily adapted to the climates in which they migrated and settled. In fact, scientists working in Tibet found that modern Tibetans may have inherited a Denisovan gene that helped them adapt to the low-oxygen environment at high altitudes.', 'Some scientists suggest that Denisovans went extinct as recently as 20,000 years ago. They may have died out due to extensive interbreeding with other hominins, meaning that they slowly became absorbed into the wider human population. It\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s also possible that as Homo sapiens encroached on Denisovan habitats, they outcompeted them for food, or introduced deadly diseases that contributed to the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 demise.

Yet, thanks to advances in DNA analysis, scientists have uncovered intriguing clues about their lives. Read on for nine facts about the mysterious Denisovans.', 'Today, all modern humans are Homo sapiens, but as a species we have taken millennia to evolve. The very earliest human ancestors (a.k.a. hominins) emerged around 7 million years ago, while species in our genus, Homo, began appearing about 2.3 million years ago. Within the last 150 years or so, scientists have discovered evidence for at least eight different hominins in Homo, from Homo erectus, the first to migrate out of Africa, to the tiny Homo floresiensis, who stood only 3 feet, 6 inches tall.', 'In 2010, Russian scientists Michael Shunkov and Anatoly Derevianko unearthed a tiny finger bone in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. The fragment was sent to the Max Planck Institute in Germany for DNA analysis, where a team led by paleogeneticist Svante P\\u00c3\\u00a4\\u00c3\\u00a4bo determined that the bone came from an unknown type of archaic human, closely related to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis.', 'The first bone fragment was found in the Denisova cave, which lent its name to the mysterious hominins. This incredible site is the only place in the world known to have been occupied by more than one hominin group. Fossils and debris from the many layers of cave floor provide evidence that the cave was inhabited by Denisovans roughly 200,000 years ago, by Neanderthals 100,000 years ago, and by modern humans. At some point, the two groups of extinct hominins may have coexisted there.', 'The Denisovans are especially mysterious because archaeologists have uncovered so few fossils, meaning that we don\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really know what they looked like. The only known fossils so far confirmed as Denisovan include three loose teeth, a skull fragment, a finger bone, half of a broken jawbone, and four other small slivers of bone. The remains were identified as Denisovan by protein or DNA analysis rather than morphology, and fascinating questions about the physical characteristics of these ancient human ancestors are still to be answered.', 'Scientists continue to search for more Denisovan bones. Fossils found in China, Taiwan, and Kyrgyzstan are thought to be likely contenders; however, their poor quality have precluded any DNA extraction and analysis. At this stage, it\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unclear if they are Denisovan or belong to another hominin group.', 'The Denisovans are the only hominin identified as distinct from other hominins by DNA alone. Because so few of their fossils have been found\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94and because the ones we have are mere fragments\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94scientists haven\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t determined the anatomy of a Denisovan. Without the physical description, they can\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be confirmed as a new species or subspecies. For now, Denisovans are considered a \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpopulation\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in the genus Homo.', 'Researchers looking at human evolution have suggested that the human ancestor Homo heidelbergensis, which lived between 600,000 and 300,000 years ago, left Africa about 400,000 years ago. Some moved west into Europe and likely evolved into Neanderthals, while others traveled into central Asia and became the Denisovans.', 'Hominin groups that remained in Africa evolved into Homo sapiens. By 60,000 years ago, this group had also migrated into Europe and Asia, and lived alongside Neanderthals and Denisovans for several thousand years.', 'In 2018, analysis of a bone fragment found in Siberia revealed that it came from a teenage girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, providing the only known evidence of a first-generation hybrid hominin. The girl, nicknamed \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDenny,\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was thought to have lived 90,000 years ago. DNA evidence shows that Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans were related closely enough that they could interbreed and bear children, and that Neanderthals and Denisovans were more closely related to each other than to Homo sapiens.', 'The fossilized remains of Denisovans come from just two locations, Siberia and Tibet (though a tooth found in Laos may also be Denisovan). Their genetic legacy, however,  suggests they inhabited large swaths of Asia. DNA analysis of modern humans in Southeast Asia shows that many people have traces of Denisovan DNA, suggesting modern humans in the region interbred with Denisovans many thousands of years ago and indicating that they lived much farther south than had been initially thought.', 'Genetic evidence from Papua New Guinea hints that some modern humans may have interbred with Denisovans as recently as 25,000 years ago, implying that Homo sapiens and Denisovans coexisted in these areas for thousands of years. Today, the Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines, modern New Guineans, and Aboriginal Australians may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their genes to Denisovan DNA.', 'The Denisovans lived harsh environments, from the cold, frozen steppes of Siberia to the high altitudes of Tibet. The excavations in Laos also suggest that some Denisovan communities lived in the lush tropical woodlands of Southeast Asia. The variety of the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 habitats implies that they readily adapted to the climates in which they migrated and settled. In fact, scientists working in Tibet found that modern Tibetans may have inherited a Denisovan gene that helped them adapt to the low-oxygen environment at high altitudes.', 'Some scientists suggest that Denisovans went extinct as recently as 20,000 years ago. They may have died out due to extensive interbreeding with other hominins, meaning that they slowly became absorbed into the wider human population. It\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s also possible that as Homo sapiens encroached on Denisovan habitats, they outcompeted them for food, or introduced deadly diseases that contributed to the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 demise. In the future, if more Denisovan remains are identified, archaeologists may be able to discover more answers to these elusive early hominins.', 'Read More Stories About Human Evolution:', 'manual', '\\u00c2\\u00a9 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']\",\n          \"['\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you want something done right, do it yourself\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is an old adage that doesn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem like it would apply to major surgery.

Yet, thanks to advances in DNA analysis, scientists have uncovered intriguing clues about their lives. Read on for nine facts about the mysterious Denisovans.', 'Today, all modern humans are Homo sapiens, but as a species we have taken millennia to evolve. The very earliest human ancestors (a.k.a. hominins) emerged around 7 million years ago, while species in our genus, Homo, began appearing about 2.3 million years ago. Within the last 150 years or so, scientists have discovered evidence for at least eight different hominins in Homo, from Homo erectus, the first to migrate out of Africa, to the tiny Homo floresiensis, who stood only 3 feet, 6 inches tall.', 'In 2010, Russian scientists Michael Shunkov and Anatoly Derevianko unearthed a tiny finger bone in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. The fragment was sent to the Max Planck Institute in Germany for DNA analysis, where a team led by paleogeneticist Svante P\\u00c3\\u00a4\\u00c3\\u00a4bo determined that the bone came from an unknown type of archaic human, closely related to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis.', 'The first bone fragment was found in the Denisova cave, which lent its name to the mysterious hominins. This incredible site is the only place in the world known to have been occupied by more than one hominin group. Fossils and debris from the many layers of cave floor provide evidence that the cave was inhabited by Denisovans roughly 200,000 years ago, by Neanderthals 100,000 years ago, and by modern humans. At some point, the two groups of extinct hominins may have coexisted there.', 'The Denisovans are especially mysterious because archaeologists have uncovered so few fossils, meaning that we don\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really know what they looked like. The only known fossils so far confirmed as Denisovan include three loose teeth, a skull fragment, a finger bone, half of a broken jawbone, and four other small slivers of bone. The remains were identified as Denisovan by protein or DNA analysis rather than morphology, and fascinating questions about the physical characteristics of these ancient human ancestors are still to be answered.', 'Scientists continue to search for more Denisovan bones. Fossils found in China, Taiwan, and Kyrgyzstan are thought to be likely contenders; however, their poor quality have precluded any DNA extraction and analysis. At this stage, it\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unclear if they are Denisovan or belong to another hominin group.', 'The Denisovans are the only hominin identified as distinct from other hominins by DNA alone. Because so few of their fossils have been found\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94and because the ones we have are mere fragments\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94scientists haven\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t determined the anatomy of a Denisovan. Without the physical description, they can\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be confirmed as a new species or subspecies. For now, Denisovans are considered a \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpopulation\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in the genus Homo.', 'Researchers looking at human evolution have suggested that the human ancestor Homo heidelbergensis, which lived between 600,000 and 300,000 years ago, left Africa about 400,000 years ago. Some moved west into Europe and likely evolved into Neanderthals, while others traveled into central Asia and became the Denisovans.', 'Hominin groups that remained in Africa evolved into Homo sapiens. By 60,000 years ago, this group had also migrated into Europe and Asia, and lived alongside Neanderthals and Denisovans for several thousand years.', 'In 2018, analysis of a bone fragment found in Siberia revealed that it came from a teenage girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, providing the only known evidence of a first-generation hybrid hominin. The girl, nicknamed \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDenny,\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was thought to have lived 90,000 years ago. DNA evidence shows that Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans were related closely enough that they could interbreed and bear children, and that Neanderthals and Denisovans were more closely related to each other than to Homo sapiens.', 'The fossilized remains of Denisovans come from just two locations, Siberia and Tibet (though a tooth found in Laos may also be Denisovan). Their genetic legacy, however,  suggests they inhabited large swaths of Asia. DNA analysis of modern humans in Southeast Asia shows that many people have traces of Denisovan DNA, suggesting modern humans in the region interbred with Denisovans many thousands of years ago and indicating that they lived much farther south than had been initially thought.', 'Genetic evidence from Papua New Guinea hints that some modern humans may have interbred with Denisovans as recently as 25,000 years ago, implying that Homo sapiens and Denisovans coexisted in these areas for thousands of years. Today, the Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines, modern New Guineans, and Aboriginal Australians may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their genes to Denisovan DNA.', 'The Denisovans lived harsh environments, from the cold, frozen steppes of Siberia to the high altitudes of Tibet. The excavations in Laos also suggest that some Denisovan communities lived in the lush tropical woodlands of Southeast Asia. The variety of the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 habitats implies that they readily adapted to the climates in which they migrated and settled. In fact, scientists working in Tibet found that modern Tibetans may have inherited a Denisovan gene that helped them adapt to the low-oxygen environment at high altitudes.', 'Some scientists suggest that Denisovans went extinct as recently as 20,000 years ago. They may have died out due to extensive interbreeding with other hominins, meaning that they slowly became absorbed into the wider human population. It\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s also possible that as Homo sapiens encroached on Denisovan habitats, they outcompeted them for food, or introduced deadly diseases that contributed to the Denisovans\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99 demise. In the future, if more Denisovan remains are identified, archaeologists may be able to discover more answers to these elusive early hominins.', 'Read More Stories About Human Evolution:', 'manual', '\\u00c2\\u00a9 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']['archaeology', 'anthropology', 'fossils', 'evolution']\",\n          \"13 People Who Operated on Themselves['\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you want something done right, do it yourself\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is an old adage that doesn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem like it would apply to major surgery.

Rogozov first got the necessary permission all the way from Moscow, then enlisted three of his colleagues to be his assistants during the surgery. They would hand him the instruments he needed and hold a mirror so he could see what he was doing. He instructed them to inject him with adrenaline if he passed out and even told them to perform artificial ventilation if necessary. Then he injected novocaine into his abdomen and got to work\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94he\\u00c2\\\\xa0 later wrote that although he was terrified, \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9csomehow I automatically switched into operating mode, and from that point on I didn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t notice anything else.\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\u00c2\\\\xa0\\u00c2\\\\xa0', 'The surgery was not easy\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94Rogozov had to discard the mirror and work by touch\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94but the surgeon did eventually reach his appendix, remove it, and stitch himself up in around two hours. Good thing, too; after looking at the organ, he estimated it would have burst within a day.\\u00c2\\\\xa0 Rogozov went back to work two weeks later.', 'Some countries, like Australia, have since mandated that physicians headed for the Antarctic have their appendix removed via elective surgery before traveling there.', 'Rogozov isn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the only person to have taken out their own appendix. There\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s also the Australian veterinary surgeon Robert Kerr McLaren, who removed the organ in a jungle in the Philippines sans anesthesia in the 1940s, and Dr. Evan Kane, who we\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get to later in this list.', 'You might not know Gouverneur Morris\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name, but you\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve probably read his work: He tweaked some of the language of the Constitution, earning himself the moniker \\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Penman of the Constitution.\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was also a U.S. senator and a one-time minister to France, and has the dubious distinction of being the only Founding Father to stick whalebone in his penis (at least that we know about).', 'Here\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what happened: In 1816, Morris\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health was on the decline. In addition to having a raging case of gout, he was also having trouble urinating, possibly due to a urinary tract infection. He was unable to pee and was, understandably, probably freaking out. So he decided to grab a piece of whalebone that may have come from his wife\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s corset and stick it up there in an attempt to clear the blockage. He had maybe done it once before with a piece of flexible hickory, and it had worked like a charm\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x94so he likely had reasonable confidence that this, too, would be successful.', 'It wasn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.

He made a tourniquet from bungee cords to stop the bleeding at one point, but that could have potentially made matters worse: If the communications didn\\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go offline, Carlin would have told him the tourniquet was just going to cut the blood supply off to his arm completely and cause him to lose it.', 'When the communication was back up, Carlin instructed him to instead apply direct pressure to the wound to help stop the bleeding.

southern siberia the fragment was sent to the max planck institute in germany for dna analysis where a team led by paleogeneticist svante p\\u00e3\\u00a4\\u00e3\\u00a4bo determined that the bone came from an unknown type of archaic human closely related to both homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis the first bone fragment was found in the denisova cave which lent its name to the mysterious hominins this incredible site is the only place in the world known to have been occupied by more than one hominin group fossils and debris from the many layers of cave floor provide evidence that the cave was inhabited by denisovans roughly 200000 years ago by neanderthals 100000 years ago and by modern humans at some point the two groups of extinct hominins may have coexisted there the denisovans are especially mysterious because archaeologists have uncovered so few fossils meaning that we dont really know what they looked like the only known fossils so far confirmed as denisovan include three loose teeth a skull fragment a finger bone half of a broken jawbone and four other small slivers of bone the remains were identified as denisovan by protein or dna analysis rather than morphology and fascinating questions about the physical characteristics of these ancient human ancestors are still to be answered scientists continue to search for more denisovan bones fossils found in china taiwan and kyrgyzstan are thought to be likely contenders however their poor quality have precluded any dna extraction and analysis at this stage its unclear if they are denisovan or belong to another hominin group the denisovans are the only hominin identified as distinct from other hominins by dna alone because so few of their fossils have been found and because the ones we have are mere fragments scientists havent determined the anatomy of a denisovan without the physical description they cant be confirmed as a new species or subspecies for now denisovans are considered a population in the genus homo researchers looking at human evolution have suggested that the human ancestor homo heidelbergensis which lived between 600000 and 300000 years ago left africa about 400000 years ago some moved west into europe and likely evolved into neanderthals while others traveled into central asia and became the denisovans hominin groups that remained in africa evolved into homo sapiens by 60000 years ago this group had also migrated into europe and asia and lived alongside neanderthals and denisovans for several thousand years in 2018 analysis of a bone fragment found in siberia revealed that it came from a teenage girl with a neanderthal mother and a denisovan father providing the only known evidence of a firstgeneration hybrid hominin the girl nicknamed denny was thought to have lived 90000 years ago dna evidence shows that denisovans neanderthals and modern humans were related closely enough that they could interbreed and bear children and that neanderthals and denisovans were more closely related to each other than to homo sapiens the fossilized remains of denisovans come from just two locations siberia and tibet though a tooth found in laos may also be denisovan their genetic legacy however suggests they inhabited large swaths of asia dna analysis of modern humans in southeast asia shows that many people have traces of denisovan dna suggesting modern humans in the region interbred with denisovans many thousands of years ago and indicating that they lived much farther south than had been initially thought genetic evidence from papua new guinea hints that some modern humans may have interbred with denisovans as recently as 25000 years ago implying that homo sapiens and denisovans coexisted in these areas for thousands of years today the indigenous ayta magbukon people in the philippines modern new guineans and aboriginal australians may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their genes to denisovan dna the denisovans lived harsh environments from the cold frozen steppes of siberia to the high altitudes of tibet the excavations in laos also suggest that some denisovan communities lived in the lush tropical woodlands of southeast asia the variety of the denisovans habitats implies that they readily adapted to the climates in which they migrated and settled in fact scientists working in tibet found that modern tibetans may have inherited a denisovan gene that helped them adapt to the lowoxygen environment at high altitudes some scientists suggest that denisovans went extinct as recently as 20000 years ago they may have died out due to extensive interbreeding with other hominins meaning that they slowly became absorbed into the wider human population its also possible that as homo sapiens encroached on denisovan habitats they outcompeted them for food or introduced deadly diseases that contributed to the denisovans demise in the future if more denisovan remains are identified archaeologists may be able to discover more answers to these elusive early hominins read more stories about human evolution manual archaeology anthropology fossils evolution\",\n          \"13 people who operated on themselves if you want something done right do it yourself is an old adage that doesnt seem like it would apply to major surgery for a handful of people however the notion of cutting themselves open to relieve a condition seemed like a good idea or their only option take a look at some of historys autosurgical pioneers in april 1961 leonid rogozov found himself in a bit of a pickle the 27yearold surgeon was part of a soviet expedition to antarctica when he got sick with what he eventually realized was appendicitis there were no other doctors on the expedition the weather made flying anywhere impossible not to mention the fact that travel back to russia by sea took almost 40 days so rogozov who wrote in his journal that the pain felt like a snowstorm whipping through my soul wailing like a hundred jackals decided that the only option he had if he wanted to live was to take a scalpel to himself what do you do if youre stuck in antarctica and you need to operate on yourself rogozov first got the necessary permission all the way from moscow then enlisted three of his colleagues to be his assistants during the surgery they would hand him the instruments he needed and hold a mirror so he could see what he was doing he instructed them to inject him with adrenaline if he passed out and even told them to perform artificial ventilation if necessary then he injected novocaine into his abdomen and got to work he later wrote that although he was terrified somehow i automatically switched into operating mode and from that point on i didnt notice anything else the surgery was not easy rogozov had to discard the mirror and work by touch but the surgeon did eventually reach his appendix remove it and stitch himself up in around two hours good thing too after looking at the organ he estimated it would have burst within a day rogozov went back to work two weeks later some countries like australia have since mandated that physicians headed for the antarctic have their appendix removed via elective surgery before traveling there rogozov isnt the only person to have taken out their own appendix theres also the australian veterinary surgeon robert kerr mclaren who removed the organ in a jungle in the philippines sans anesthesia in the 1940s and dr evan kane who well get to later in this list you might not know gouverneur morriss name but youve probably read his work he tweaked some of the language of the constitution earning himself the moniker the penman of the constitution he was also a us senator and a onetime minister to france and has the dubious distinction of being the only founding father to stick whalebone in his penis at least that we know about heres what happened in 1816 morriss health was on the decline in addition to having a raging case of gout he was also having trouble urinating possibly due to a urinary tract infection he was unable to pee and was understandably probably freaking out so he decided to grab a piece of whalebone that may have come from his wifes corset and stick it up there in an attempt to clear the blockage he had maybe done it once before with a piece of flexible hickory and it had worked like a charm so he likely had reasonable confidence that this too would be successful it wasnt morris ended up with a penile infection and died on november 6 1816 in 2003 27yearold climber aron ralston was exploring a canyon in utah when a boulder dislodged itself and trapped his right arm to the wall with no phone reception and no phone and precious little to eat or drink he decided to take the matter into his one free hand and slowly sever his trapped arm using a pocket knife he was forced to bend and break his bones to complete the job decomposition gases hissed from his wounds as he sliced the detachment had already happened in my mind he told the guardian in 2010 its rubbish its going to kill you get rid of it aron its an it its no longer my arm as i picked up the knife i was very cool and collected once the arm was cut ralston used his climbing gear as a tourniquet and climbed the 65 feet up and out of the canyon the harrowing experience which ralston survived became the subject of the 2010 movie 127 hours named for the amount of time ralston was stuck under the boulder before he managed to free himself bladder stones are horrifically painful and just a few hundred years ago the surgery to remove them sounds like a whole other form of torture surgeons would stick a finger in the patients rectum to locate the bladder then go through the perineum you know that stretch between the genitals and the anus to make a small incision in the organ next theyd use forceps or something called a scoop extractor to remove the stones after that theyd apparently just \\u00e2x80\\u00a6 let the wounds heal all on their own no sewing anything up the procedure known as a lithotomy was notorious for its high mortality rate and rather than sit for another horrific operation surgeon charlesauguste clever de maldigny whod had many rounds of bladder stones before opted to relieve his agony himself with the help of a mirror he sliced into his bladder and pulled out a stone that had apparently formed around a surgical sponge left in during one of the previous operations and he didnt die but he also didnt get rid of his bladder stones forever when they returned years later de maldigny opted to have someone else remove them using a new and less invasive procedure called a lithotrity while working on his farm near pender nebraska in 2019 63yearold kurtis kaser accidentally got his leg caught in a grain auger the device began to consume his left foot and threatened to mutilate more of him if he didnt act quickly kaser used his pocket knife to cut off the remains of his leg then crawled on his elbows for hundreds of feet to get to a phone at the hospital the staff performed a clean amputation between his knee and ankle kaser used the ensuing press attention to remind people to take time and think when in a precarious situation you probably dont need anyone to tell you that moms are amazing but in\\u00e3\\u00a9s ram\\u00e3xadrez perez took it to a whole new level the 40yearold was at home at a remote location in southern mexico in march 2000 when she went into labor the nearest clinic was over 50 miles away and she had no way to get there the labor was difficult and perez had previously had a stillbirth so after 12 hours with no baby she took some shots of hard liquor and used a 6inch knife to cut the baby out they both survived there were reportedly no witnesses to the actual surgery but one of the doctors who examined perez 12 hours after the birth said that it was evident this surgery was not done by anyone with medical knowledge there is no doctor or healer in the village and it is highly doubtful that anyone would have been able to do this to her if they had it is such a small town the word would have spread quickly and we would have known perez is believed to be the only woman to have ever successfully given herself a csection in 1970 uk native amanda feilding who was interested in how to access deeper parts of her consciousness decided to drill a hole in her own skull a practice known as trepanation its one of the worlds oldest known surgeries and dates back at least 7000 years feilding thought that doing so would potentially increase blood circulation to her brain though there was a lack of evidence for this feilding used a dental drill to bore a hole in her forehead as blood spurted from the wound and she recorded the whole thing when the footage was screened at suydam gallery in new york in 1978 it caused some audience members to faint its not a difficult operation she would later say adding drilling a hole in ones head is really a nerve battle doing something which obviously e\\u00e2xadvery instinct in your body is against in a sense its quite satisfying that one can overcome ones nerves to do it feilding would later undergo trepanation a second time albeit with someone else doing the drilling legendary danish explorer peter freuchen was made of tough stuff in the 1920s he returned to an arctic base from out on the tundra where he had survived an intense snow storm his left foot was in bad shape gangrene began to develop freuchen wrote that the flesh fell away until the bones protruded there were no doctors on site but freuchen was attended to by an indigenous woman who said she had experience with frozen limbs he would later write that when a man is sick and cold and lonely he gets strange ideas and one day i told the nurse that i wanted to have those toes off she agreed that that was best and volunteered to bite his toes off at the joint which freuchen explained would prevent the ghosts from occupying my body because her mouth would close the wounds immediately he thanked her but went with his own toe removal method instead he put a nail puller over each toe and in his words banged it off with a hammer he would eventually lose his whole leg after this incident but that didnt slow him down at all freuchen was part of the danish resistance movement against the nazis and aided jewish refugees from nazi germany when he was captured by the nazis and sentenced to death he escaped he starred in a movie and won the game show the 64000 question and he also claimed to have once made a tool out of his own frozen poop to chisel his way out of an ice pit yet another example of desperate times calling for desperate measures while many cases of selfsurgery arise out of urgency ohio surgeon mohab foad opted to operate on his own hand merely out of curiosity he arrived for the scheduled surgery to repair a torn ligament in august 2021 but once he was injected with a local anesthetic he began feeling like his numbed appendage was almost disconnected from the rest of his body he later told the cincinnati enquirer that it really was a lot like it wasnt my thumb it was anybody elses and decided to just request a scalpel and operate on himself foad then exchanged surgical steps with a colleague before being sutured up in 1998 viktor yazykov was competing in a solo sailing contest that tasks contestants with traveling 27000 miles around the world in nine months thats plenty challenging on its own but then emergency struck in the middle of the south atlantic yazykov injured his right elbow and grew concerned when it began showing signs of serious infection when it didnt resolve yazykov reached out via email to boston surgeon daniel carlin who was on call as the races doctor yazykov told carlin his arm felt dead and like a pillow with some liquid inside carlin emailed him stepbystep instructions on how to puncture and drain the abscess though he couldnt take him through it in realtime the sun had gone down when yazykov began the procedure cutting off access to his solarpowered communication equipment with the emergency tools provided to each competitor by the world clinic two scalpels gloves iodine a scrub and cotton gauze he got to work it turned out that puncturing the abscess wasnt the issue the real danger came from the fact that yazykov experienced heavy bleeding partly due to some aspirin he had taken that thinned his blood he made a tourniquet from bungee cords to stop the bleeding at one point but that could have potentially made matters worse if the communications didnt go offline carlin would have told him the tourniquet was just going to cut the blood supply off to his arm completely and cause him to lose it when the communication was back up carlin instructed him to instead apply direct pressure to the wound to help stop the bleeding yazykov wound up recovering and continued on with the race it may have helped that yazykov was once a russian special forces commando and prone to keeping his cool in tense situations operating on yourself feels like an experience you wouldnt want to repeat but that wasnt the case for dr evan oneill kane a pennsylvaniabased surgeon who in 1919 amputated his own finger then in 1921 he decided to do a selfsurgery for science kane was wary of general asthesia so he tested whether or not local anesthetic would work by giving himself an appendectomy and he actually needed it kane suffered from chronic appendicitis after the surgery he told the new york times i now know exactly how the patient feels when being operated upon under local treatment and that was one of the objects i had in mind when i determined to perform the operation myself about a decade later the 70yearold surgeon operated on his own hernia caused by taking a tumble from a horse kane wasnt the only doctor to operate on his own hernia or even the first in 1909 26yearold romanian surgeon m alexandre fzaicou removed a henseggsized inguinal hernia which medical news today describes as a condition in which some of the contents of the abdominal cavity push through a weak spot in the wall of the abdomen and form a painful swelling in the groin area yeowch it took fzaicou a few times to get the right injection spot but once he did and the drugs kicked in he sat upright and cut into himself ultimately performing an hourlong surgery twelve days later he was back at work finally lets head to germany in 1929 where dr werner theodor otto forssmann had developed an experimental plan to catheterize the heart for operations like repairing mitral valve defects he submitted it to his hospitals chief of surgery who refused to allow any patients to undergo the procedure when forssmann offered himself as the patient the chief refused again undaunted forssmann enlisted a nurse who volunteered to act as the patient but when they got in the operating room forssmann merely pantomimed performing the surgery on her and actually catheterized himself classic bait and switch afterward he apparently walked out to the xray department to see if hed reached his heart he hadnt and needed to insert the catheter a little further he would later win the the nobel prize for physiology or medicine for 1956 alongside andr\\u00e3\\u00a9 fr\\u00e3\\u00a9d\\u00e3\\u00a9ric cournand and dickinson w

that you might not be around for it heres what we know about the great beyond thats mainly because two states new york and new jersey allow families to reject the concept of brain death if it goes against their religious beliefs one of the first visible indicators of death is when the eyes cloud over as fluid and oxygen stop flowing to the corneas that can happen within 10 minutes after death if the eyes were open and 24 hours if the eyes were closed today there are about 300 bodies frozen in liquid nitrogen in america in the hope that science will one day be able to bring them back to life contrary to popular belief walt disney is not one of them its a myth that hair and nails grow after death what really happens is that the body dries out so the nail beds and skin on the head retract making nails stubble and hair appear longer rigor mortis a result of certain fibers in the muscle cells becoming linked by chemical bonds but it usually goes away in a day or two as those bonds break down how long it lasts depends on the temperature in the environment among other factors two of the gases responsible for the distinctive smell of death are called putrescine and cadaverine theyre produced when bacteria break down the amino acids ornithine and lysine respectively technically known as adipocere and sometimes also called grave wax its a byproduct of decomposition that happens as the fat in a body decays under wet anaerobic lacking in oxygen conditions philadelphias m\\u00e3\\u00bctter museum has an adipocerecovered corpse on display while the

famous examples of these bog bodies is the iron age tollund man in denmark when his body was discovered in 1950 it looked so fresh his discoverers thought theyd found a recent murder victim the necrobiome comprises all the bacteria and fungi in a corpse scientists are hoping to figure out whether changes in the microbes alone can provide clues to the time of death the concept is known as the

have ever be discover yet thank to advance in dna analysis scientist have uncover intriguing clue about their life read on for nine fact about the mysterious denisovan today all modern human be homo sapiens but as a specie we have take millennium to evolve the very early human ancestor aka hominin emerge around 7 million year ago while specie in our genus homo begin appear about 23 million year ago within the last 150 year or so scientist have discover evidence for at least eight different hominin in homo from homo erectus the first to migrate out of africa to the tiny homo floresiensis who stand only 3 foot 6 inch tall in 2010 russian scientist michael shunkov and anatoly derevianko unearth a tiny finger bone in the altai mountain in southern siberia the fragment be send to the max planck institute in germany for dna analysis where a team lead by paleogeneticist svante p\\u00e3\\u00a4\\u00e3\\u00a4bo determine that the bone come from an unknown type of archaic human closely relate to both homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis the first bone fragment be find in the denisova cave which lend its name to the mysterious hominin this incredible site be the only place in the world know to have be occupy by more than one hominin group fossil and debris from the many layer of cave floor provide evidence that the cave be inhabit by denisovan roughly 200000 year ago by neanderthal 100000 year ago and by modern human at some point the two group of extinct hominin may have coexist there the denisovan be especially mysterious because archaeologist have uncover so few fossil mean that we do not really know what they look like the only know fossil so far confirm as denisovan include three loose tooth a skull fragment a finger bone half of a break jawbone and four other small sliver of bone the remain be identify as denisovan by protein or dna analysis rather than morphology and fascinating question about the physical characteristic of these ancient human ancestor be still to be answer scientist continue to search for more denisovan bone fossil find in china taiwan and kyrgyzstan be think to be likely contender however their poor quality have preclude any dna extraction and analysis at this stage its unclear if they be denisovan or belong to another hominin group the denisovan be the only hominin identify as distinct from other hominin by dna alone because so few of their fossil have be find and because the one we have be mere fragment scientist have not determine the anatomy of a denisovan without the physical description they can not be confirm as a new specie or subspecie for now denisovan be consider a population in the genus homo researcher look at human evolution have suggest that the human ancestor homo heidelbergensis which live between 600000 and 300000 year ago leave africa about 400000 year ago some move west into europe and likely evolve into neanderthal while other travel into central asia and become the denisovan hominin group that remain in africa evolve into homo sapiens by 60000 year ago this group have also migrate into europe and asia and live alongside neanderthal and denisovan for several thousand year in 2018 analysis of a bone fragment find in siberia reveal that it come from a teenage girl with a neanderthal mother and a denisovan father provide the only know evidence of a firstgeneration hybrid hominin the girl nickname denny be think to have live 90000 year ago dna evidence show that denisovan neanderthal and modern human be relate closely enough that they could interbreed and bear child and that neanderthal and denisovan be more closely related to each other than to homo sapiens the fossilize remain of denisovan come from just two location siberia and tibet though a tooth find in laos may also be denisovan their genetic legacy however suggest they inhabit large swath of asia dna analysis of modern human in southeast asia show that many people have trace of denisovan dna suggest modern human in the region interbreed with denisovan many thousand of year ago and indicate that they live much far south than have be initially think genetic evidence from papua new guinea hint that some modern human may have interbreed with denisovan as recently as 25000 year ago imply that homo sapiens and denisovan coexist in these area for thousand of year today the indigenous ayta magbukon people in the philippine modern new guinean and aboriginal australian may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their gene to denisovan dna the denisovan live harsh environment from the cold frozen steppe of siberia to the high altitude of tibet the excavation in laos also suggest that some denisovan community live in the lush tropical woodland of southeast asia the variety of the denisovans habitat imply that they readily adapt to the climate in which they migrate and settle in fact scientist work in tibet find that modern tibetan may have inherit a denisovan gene that help they adapt to the lowoxygen environment at high altitude some scientist suggest that denisovan go extinct as recently as 20000 year ago they may have die out due to extensive interbreed with other hominin mean that they slowly became absorb into the wide human population its also possible that as homo sapiens encroach on denisovan habitat they outcompete they for food or introduce deadly disease that contribute to the denisovan demise in the future if more denisovan remain be identify archaeologist may be able to discover more answer to these elusive early hominin read more story

seem like it would apply to major surgery for a handful of people however the notion of cut themselves open to relieve a condition seem like a good idea or their only option take a look at some of historys autosurgical pioneer in april 1961 leonid rogozov find himself in a bit of a pickle the 27yearold surgeon be part of a soviet expedition to antarctica when he get sick with what he eventually realize be appendicitis there be no other doctor on the expedition the weather make fly anywhere impossible not to mention the fact that travel back to russia by sea take almost 40 day so rogozov who write in his journal that the pain feel like a snowstorm whip through my soul wail like a hundred jackal decide that the only option he have if he want to live be to take a scalpel to himself what do you do if you re stuck in antarctica and you need to operate on yourself rogozov first get the necessary permission all the way from moscow then enlist three of his colleague to be his assistant during the surgery they would hand he the instrument he need and hold a mirror so he could see what he be do he instruct they to inject he with adrenaline if he pass out and even tell they to perform artificial ventilation if necessary then he inject novocaine into his abdomen and get to work he later write that although he be terrify somehow I automatically switch into operating mode and from that point on I do not notice anything else the surgery be not easy rogozov have to discard the mirror and work by touch but the surgeon do eventually reach his appendix remove it and stitch himself up in around two hour good thing too after look at the organ he estimate it would have burst within a day rogozov go back to work two week later some country like australia have since mandate that physician head for the antarctic have their appendix remove via elective surgery before travel there rogozov be not the only person to have take out their own appendix there s also the australian veterinary surgeon robert kerr mclaren who remove the organ in a jungle in the philippine san anesthesia in the 1940 and dr evan kane who well get to later in this list you might not know gouverneur morriss name but you ve probably read his work he tweak some of the language of the constitution earn himself the moniker the penman of the constitution he be also a us senator and a onetime minister to france and have the dubious distinction of be the only found father to stick whalebone in his penis at least that we know about here what happen in 1816 morriss health be on the decline in addition to have a rage case of gout he be also have trouble urinate possibly due to a urinary tract infection he be unable to pee and be understandably probably freak out so he decide to grab a piece of whalebone that may have come from his wife corset and stick it up there in an attempt to clear the blockage he have maybe do it once before with a piece of flexible hickory and it have work like a charm so he likely have reasonable confidence that this too would be successful it be not morris end up with a penile infection and die on november 6 1816 in 2003 27yearold climber aron ralston be explore a canyon in utah when a boulder dislodge itself and trap his right arm to the wall with no phone reception and no phone and precious little to eat or drink he decide to take the matter into his one free hand and slowly sever his trap arm use a pocket knife he be force to bend and break his bone to complete the job decomposition gas hiss from his wound as he slice the detachment have already happen in my mind he tell the guardian in 2010 its rubbish its go to kill you get rid of it aron its an it its no long my arm as I pick up the knife I be very cool and collect once the arm be cut ralston use his climbing gear as a tourniquet and climb the 65 foot up and out of the canyon the harrowing experience which ralston survive become the subject of the 2010 movie 127 hour name for the amount of time ralston be stick under the boulder before he manage to free himself bladder stone be horrifically painful and just a few hundred year ago the surgery to remove they sound like a whole other form of torture surgeon would stick a finger in the patient rectum to locate the bladder then go through the perineum you know that stretch between the genital and the anus to make a small incision in the organ next they d use forcep or something call a scoop extractor to remove the stone after that they d apparently just \\u00e2x80 \\u00a6 let the wound heal all on their own no sewing anything up the procedure know as a lithotomy be notorious for its high mortality rate and rather than sit for another horrific operation surgeon charlesauguste clever de maldigny who d have many round of bladder stone before opt to relieve his agony himself with the help of a mirror he slice into his bladder and pull out a stone that have apparently form around a surgical sponge leave in during one of the previous operation and he do not die but he also do not get rid of his bladder stone forever when they return year later de maldigny opt to have someone else remove they use a new

when she go into labor the near clinic be over 50 mile away and she have no way to get there the labor be difficult and perez have previously have a stillbirth so after 12 hour with no baby she take some shot of hard liquor and use a 6inch knife to cut the baby out they both survive there be reportedly no witness to the actual surgery but one of the doctor who examine perez 12 hour after the birth say that it be evident this surgery be not do by anyone with medical knowledge there be no doctor or healer in the village and it be highly doubtful that anyone would have be able to do this to she if they have it be such a small town the word would have spread quickly and we would have know perez be believe to be the only woman to have ever successfully give herself a csection in 1970 uk native amanda feilde who be interested in how to access deep part of her consciousness decide to drill a hole in her own skull a practice know as trepanation its one of the world old know surgery and date back at least 7000 year feilde think that do so would potentially increase blood circulation to her brain though there be a lack of evidence for this feilding use a dental drill to bore a hole in her forehead as blood spurt from the wound and she record the whole thing when the footage be screen at suydam gallery in new york in 1978 it cause some audience member to faint its not a difficult operation she would later say add drill a hole in one head be really a nerve battle do something which obviously e\\u00e2xadvery instinct in your body be against in a sense its quite satisfying that one can overcome one nerve to do it feilde would later undergo trepanation a second time albeit with someone else do the drilling legendary danish explorer peter freuchen be make of tough stuff in the 1920 he return to an arctic base from out on the tundra where he have survive an intense snow storm his left foot be in bad shape gangrene begin to develop freuchen write that the flesh fall away until the bone protrude there be no doctor on site but freuchen be attend to by an indigenous woman who say she have experience with frozen limb he would later write that when a man be sick and cold and lonely he get strange idea and one day I tell the nurse that I want to have those toe off she agree that that be good and volunteer to bite his toe off at the joint which freuchen explain would prevent the ghost from occupy my body because her mouth would close the wound immediately he thank she but go with his own toe removal method instead he put a nail puller over each toe and in his word

underwatering and providing insufficient sunlight are common factors that can leave your plant looking worse for wear but if you notice a sudden decline in health after keeping your indoor greenery alive for years you may ask yourself can plants die of old age living things have an expiration date and plants are no exception even if theyre given undivided attention and cultivated in the perfect environment they will eventually wither and die from natural causes but it takes plants much longer to reach that point than animals unlike your pet goldfish your monstera doesnt stop growing once it reaches a certain age houseplants instead go through indeterminate growth meaning they will continue to grow and mature under the ideal conditions depending on the species this could last decades or centuries in some cases the oldest potted plant on earth is a prickly cycad planted in 1775 plants in the wild can live even longer like methuselah the 4850yearold bristlecone pine tree in california annuals are an exception to this trend they have a rigid lifespan that ends after just a year even the most lovingly caredfor plants will start to deteriorate with time after thriving for years their cells will fail to regenerate leading to poor water retention wilting leaves and eventually death but few plants live long enough to reach this stage the vast majority die from causes like improper care pests and disease if you notice your houseplant is looking under the weather and youve had it for less than a decade old age likely isnt to blame because plants never stop growing they need to be repotted in bigger vessels throughout their lifetime this should be the first step to consider if youve had a plant in the same pot for several years here are more troubleshooting tips to keep your houseplants alive plants nature news home science\",\n          \"why are peaches fuzzy fuzz on fruit is usually a bad sign but thats not the case with peaches the orange stone fruit is famous for the light layer of downy hairs coating its exterior whether you enjoy the velvety skin or prefer to peel it off you may wonder why peaches developed this unique feature in the first place while some plants use thorns and poison to passively deter predators peaches fight back with fuzz according to allrecipes insects are irritated by the fine bristles and therefore wont stick around very long after landing on the fruit this stops them from making a meal of the soft flesh or laying their eggs inside it in addition to pest control peach fuzz doubles as a natural preservative the same delicate skin and flesh that make peaches susceptible to hungry bugs put them at risk of rot under certain circumstances because water fosters bacteria excess moisture on food can speed up decay the tiny hairs on peaches delay this by collecting condensation droplets and holding them away from the fruits skin unlike much produce sold in the supermarket modern peaches arent the result of selective breeding fossilized pits found in china suggest peaches similar to the ones we eat today were growing without human intervention in the late pliocene era that doesnt mean we havent tinkered with the crop in recent history nectarines are just a type of peach weve bred to be smooth and as a result are more vulnerable to threats but even with hairless versions on the market theres still demand for the fuzzy peaches that have flourished in nature for millions of years have you got a big question youd like us to answer if so let us know by emailing us at bigquestionsmentalflosscom history food

theories introduced concepts that would help make dozens of modern technologies possible i have no special talents einstein once said i am only passionately curious here are some facts about the physicist who gave us wild hair and emc2 on march 14 1879 baby einstein emerged with a swollen misshapen head and a grossly overweight body according to denis brians book einstein a life when she got a look at him later his grandmother was terrified of the chunky child she screamed much too fat much too fat thankfully albert would eventually grow into his body however he did have trouble developing in other arenas he supposedly didnt start speaking until the age of 2 the young genius had a habit of throwing objects whenever he was displeased once a frustrated einstein even threw a chair at his teacher the 5yearold enjoyed bombarding his tutors and family members his sister maja who was often conked in the head by einsteins fusillades later quipped it takes a sound skull to be the sister of an intellectual according to a biography by alice calaprice and trevor lipscombe when he became angry his whole face turned yellow except for the tip of his nose which turned white the idea that einstein had trouble in school is a myth during summers a preteen einstein would study mathematics and physics for fun eventually mastering differential and integral calculus by age 15 but thats not to say he was a perfect student einstein hated rote learning and refused to study subjects that didnt interest him so naturally when the obstinate numberlover took the entrance exam to the polytechnic school in zurich he flunked the language zoology and botany sections einsteins iq was never tested though that hasnt stopped people from guessing lots of websites claim the physicists iq was 160 but theres simply no way of verifying that claim one fundamental problem with the estimates ive seen is that they tend to conflate intellectual ability with domainspecific achievement dean keith simonton professor emeritus of psychology at the university of california davis told biography for all we know einsteins aptitude in arenas outside of physics might have rivaled that of an average joe whenever einstein needed to relax he turned to music he started violin lessons at age 5 and at around 17 impressed his teachers at cantonal school with his playing during a music exam around 1914 when einstein lived in berlin he played sonatas with his friend and fellow theoretical physicist max planck and after he became famous einstein would play a handful of benefit concerts alongside greats like fritz kreisler music helps him when he is thinking about his theories his second wife elsa said he goes to his study comes back strikes a few chords on the piano jots something down returns to his study einstein hated wearing socks and was immensely proud of the fact that he didnt have to wear them while giving lectures at oxford in the 1930s his antipathy apparently stemmed from a childhood realization when i was young i found out that the big toe always ends up making a hole in a sock einstein reportedly said so i stopped wearing socks as an adult he typically wore an undershirt baggy trousers held by rope and a pair of occasionally womens sandals while an undergraduate in zurich einstein fell in love with sailing a passion that would persist throughout his life there was just one problem he was a horrible sailor he regularly tipped his boat over and required rescue dozens of times his sailboat was named tinef yiddish for worthless in 1935 the new york times reported on einsteins sailing misadventures with the punny headline relative tide and sand bars trap einstein as a young man einstein sported a wellmaintained head of dark hair that is until his son hans was born in 1904 like many new parents einstein discovered that having a new mouth to feed changed everything the patent clerk was so busy trying to support his family that he stopped combing his hair and visiting the barber slowly an iconic look was born einstein would spurn barbers for the rest of his life his wife elsa would cut his mop whenever it became disheveled when einstein was a patent clerk he formed a book club with two friends and called it the olympia academy the trio usually dined on sausages gruy\\u00e3\\u00a8re cheese fruit and tea but on einsteins birthday his friends brought expensive caviar as a surprise einstein who had a knack for mindlessly eating when talking about something he was passionate about began stuffing his face while discussing galileos principle of inertia totally unaware of what he was eating he later offered this excuse well if you offer gourmet foods to peasants like me you know they wont appreciate it einstein enjoyed the occasional dirty joke when he accepted his first job as a professor he said now i too am an official member of the guild of whores and when a member of his book club gave him a nameplate that said albert knight of the backside einstein proudly kept it tacked on his apartment door later in life hed tell jokes to his pet parrot bibo einstein believed the bird was depressed and needed a laugh on his 72nd birthday einstein was leaving an event held in his honor as he was getting into his car photographers asked him to smile for the camera einstein however was sick and tired of grinning for a photograph hed been doing it all evening so he popped his tongue out instead einstein liked the photo so much he put it on his greeting cards having spent seven years working in the swiss patent office einstein was naturally curious about inventing and secured approximately 50 patents during his lifetime he enjoyed tinkering with electronics and eventually patented a selfadjusting camera a refrigerator that could last 100 years and even a blouse einstein who married twice had multiple extramarital affairs including one dalliance with a possible russian spy his first marriage with mileva mari\\u00e4x87 a physicist he met at the swiss polytechnic school soured after the birth of their third child as their marriage crumbled einstein imposed a list of brusque if not cruel demands which included you will obey the following points in your relations with me 1 you will not expect intimacy from me \\u00e2x80\\u00a6 2 you will stop talking to me if i request it unsurprisingly they divorced later einstein married his cousin elsa l\\u00e3\\u00b6wenthal einstein was not part of the manhattan project but he was instrumental in getting it started in the late 1930s german scientists discovered nuclear fission of uranium a major step toward the development of the atomic bomb much of the worlds uranium was held in the congo then a colony of belgium so two hungarianamerican physicists named leo szilard and eugene wigner decided to get einstein to write a letter to his friend the queen of belgium einstein suggested a letter to a belgian minister instead but an encounter with an economist who knew president franklin d roosevelt resulted in a change in direction and a letter that prompted america to start its own experiments einstein received countless letters from the public but he always tried to answer mail sent by children in one letter a young girl complained about her troubles with math the professor supposedly wrote back do not worry about your difficulty in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater einsteins many correspondences with children filled with charm and encouragement are compiled in a book by alice calaprice called dear professor einstein after the first president of the state of israel chaim weizmann died in 1952 the prime minister asked einstein to step into the mostly ceremonial role the physicist declined writing i am deeply moved by the offer from our state of israel and at once saddened and ashamed that i cannot accept it all my life i have dealt with objective matters hence i lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions having abandoned germany in 1933 to avoid nazi persecution einstein was sensitive to the racial discrimination he saw in the united states he championed the rights of black americans and was a member of the naacp when the famed black singer marian anderson came to perform at princeton in 1937 and was denied a hotel room einstein invited her to stay in his home he was also pen pals with web du bois and when du bois became the target of the red scare einstein effectively saved him by offering to be his character witness in a 1946 speech he delivered at pennsylvanias lincoln university he called segregation a disease of white people vowing i do not intend be quiet about it yodas face was partly modeled after einsteins according to star wars specialeffects artist nick maley a picture of einstein ended up on the wall behind the yoda sculptures and the wrinkles around einsteins eyes somehow got worked into the yoda design over the course of this evolutionary process yoda slowly changed from a comparatively spritely tall skinny grasshopper kind of character into the old wise spirited gnome that we all know today its easy to assume that einsteins theories of relativity are purely theoretical but they really do affect your everyday life for instance the theory of general relativity states that gravity affects time time moves by faster for objects in space than objects here on earth and that has profound implications for many spacebased technologies especially the accuracy of your gps his theories also explain how electromagnets work and are foundational to nuclear technology einstein history lists math news physics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

lunar eclipse coming in may three or four millennia ago diviners from the shang dynasty in china observed and predicted the machinations of the heavens inscribing their findings along with their patrons prayers on the skeletal shoulder blades of oxen or sheep these oracle bones are some of the oldest known records of eclipses on earth including the oftenfaint penumbral lunar eclipse in 1604 johannes kepler coined the term penumbra in his book astronomi\\u00e3\\u00a6 pars optica or the optical part of astronomy pdf the word consists of the new latin p\\u00e3\\u00a6ne nearly almost and the old latin word umbra shade shadow kepler used it to describe a portion of shadow near the edges of a circular body that is still partially illuminated a gray area a graduated step to the much darker umbra further from the bodys edges and the key difference between a penumbral and a total lunar eclipse just like their solar counterparts lunar eclipses are all about shadows and alignment instead of the relevant bodies in the order sunmoonearth though its sunearthmoon and theres also a difference in scale when these celestial bodies align just right in a total solar eclipse the moons shadow dances along a tiny portion of the earths curved surface but in a total lunar eclipse the entire moon is swallowed by the earths central shadow its umbra when the bodies are perfectly aligned but thanks to our eccentric wobbly moon with its 5degree tilt from the normal orbital plane appropriately called the ecliptic about a third of all lunar eclipses only ever hit the partially illuminated shadow of the earths penumbra and are thus classified as penumbral lunar eclipses something to keep in mind eclipses never occur in isolation if you know of an upcoming lunar eclipse check the surrounding weeks on the calendar for its solar pair shortly after the rare hybrid solar eclipse coming up on thursday april 20 which will be seen in parts of western australia and southeast asia the penumbral lunar eclipse will take place on the night of friday may 5 the gradual darkening of the moon as it slips silently into the partiallyilluminated shadow of our world will be visible to people all over africa asia australia and europe just like the diviners of yore moon astronomy space look up\",\n          \"venus and a strawberry moon will brighten skies this weekend with the summer

strawberry moon coincides with venuss greatest eastern elongation on june 3 venus is the brightest planet in our solar system and this weekend it will look especially brilliant as the sun sets this saturday the planet will appear 45 degrees east of it which marks its greatest possible distance from the suns position in the twilight sky just after sunset is the best time to see the evening star as it rises above the western horizon if you miss its maximum elongation the second planet from the sun will continue to shine brightly through midaugust june 3 comes with a bonus celestial event a full strawberry moon despite its colorful name the strawberry moon wont necessarily look different from the last full moon you saw the moniker comes from the fact that its the first and this month only full moon of june the month that kicks off strawberrypicking season in north america if you want to see it look for it in the eastern sky opposite the setting sun the midsummer moon will stay close to the horizon as the night progresses the higher the suns path during the day the lower the moon will hang in the sky at night and vice versa throughout the year otherwise you can wait a few weeks to catch julys buck moon which also happens to be one of four supermoons in 2023 to some astronomy fans this weekends spectacles are just a warmup for the big event on june 21 heres everything

april 22 earth day the lyrid meteor shower will peak over the northern hemisphere make some time for the celestial show and youll probably see meteors zooming across the heavens every few minutes here is everything you need to know about this meteor shower every 4155 years the comet thatcher circles the sun in a highly eccentric orbit shaped almost like a cats eye at its farthest from the sun its billions of miles from pluto at its nearest it swings between earth and mars the last time it was near earth was in 1861 and it wont be that close again until 2280 thats quite a journey and more pressingly quite a variation in temperature the closer it gets to the sun the more debris it sheds that debris is what youre seeing when you see a meteor shower dustsized particles slamming into earths atmosphere at tens of thousands of miles per hour in a competition between the two earth is going to win and shooting stars are the result of energy released as the particles are vaporized you can expect to see 20 meteors per hour during a lyrid event the comet was first spotted on april 4 1861 by ae thatcher an amateur skywatcher in new york city earning him kudos from the noted astronomer sir john herschel clues to the comets discovery are in its astronomical designation c1861 g1 the c means its a longperiod comet with an orbit of more than 200 years g stands for the first half of april and the 1 indicates it was the first comet discovered in that timeframe sightings of the lyrid meteor shower named after lyra the constellation it appears to originate from are much older the first record dates to china in the 7th century bce the night of april 21 2024 features a waxing gibbous moon that will be almost full the full moon dubbed the pink moon after the spring flowers that tend to bloom at this time is on april 23 that means that the moon will probably reflect significant light and obscure views of the meteors for your best shot at witnessing the lyrids youre going to need to get away from local light pollution and find truly dark skies you should completely avoid smartphones flashlights car headlights or dome lights the goal is to let your eyes adjust totally to the darkness once you find your viewing area just lay out your blanket get comfy look up and wait in an hour youll be able to see the night sky with surprising clarity where is the nearest dark sky to where you live you can find out on the dark site finder map you dont need a telescope to see a meteor shower but if you bring one aim it south to find jupiter its the bright unblinking spot in the sky with a telescope you should be able to make out its stripes those five stars surrounding it are the constellation libra youll notice also four tiny points of light nearby those are the galilean moons io europa ganymede and callisto when galileo discovered those moons in 1610 he was able to prove the copernican model of heliocentricity that earth goes around the sun if you miss the show this april dont panic the lyrid meteor shower will be back next year and the year after and so on but if you are eager for another celestial display before then the eta aquarids will be at their strongest on may

have float down into the us prompt poor air quality alert across the northeast and midwest and even as far south as south carolina one of the main reason this kind of pollution can cause breathing issue be because the particulate matter call pm 25 since the diameter of each particle be 25 micrometer or small be so fine for reference the diameter of a single human hair be nearly 30 time large than a pm 25 particle we have defense in our upper airway to trap large particle and prevent they from get down into the lung these be sort of the right size to get past those defense dr david hill a connecticutbase pulmonologist and member of the american lung associations national board of director tell pbs newshour people with exist respiratory condition like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma as well as people with heart condition old people and child should be extra careful when wildfire diminish the air quality but what exactly do extra careful mean here be four way to stay safe the easy way to avoid the air pollution outside be simply to avoid be outside skip the strenuous outdoor workout in favor of an indoor one and keep door and window close so the pollution stay outside the directive to remain inside go for pet too especially bird and any animal with cardiovascular or respiratory disease the american veterinary medical association recommend keep outdoor bathroom break as short as possible and if your pet have irritated or overly watery eye nasal discharge an increase breathing rate or any of these other symptom its good to call your veterinarian if you have an air filter now the time to turn it on or you can turn on your air conditioner which also filter the air as long as you replace the hvac filter often enough if you do have to head somewhere in the car take advantage of your vehicle air recirculation button as its name suggest this button continually recirculate the alreadyfiltered air inside your car rather than pull in new polluted air from outside n95 and kn95 mask do not just keep out pathogen they re also heavyduty enough to block pm 25 and other pollutant from enter your lung its not a bad idea to don one before venture outside

out your agaragar and polish off your centrifuge its time to take a look at controversial beginning of molecular gastronomy molecular gastronomy be synonymous with modernist cuisine today but its origin date back century accord to food historian gilly lehmann medieval and renaissance chef be scientist of a sort they often incorporate contemporary medical belief into their dish and be know to use the new science around they to contribute to their culinary pyrotechnic that s not a figurative statement the 15thcentury manuscript the vivendier have a wellnigh unmakeable and almost certainly

the sound of a chicken in the 17th century french physicist denis papin create what be term a digester a diner from the royal society who have go to check out the invention write that it make the hard bone of beef itself and mutton as soft as cheese papin have invent the ancestor of the modern pressure cooker in the 1700s exciting new discovery from the field of chemistry be apply to the culinary art french chemist antoine baum\\u00e3 \\u00a9 invent a method to measure the specific gravity of liquid now know as the baum\\u00e3 \\u00a9 scale specific gravity be also call relative density which be a good indication of its meaning it compare the density of substance to a reference material which when measure liquid be usually water for year baum\\u00e3 \\u00a9 s method be an important tool in many area of food production from brew beer to winemake its since be largely supplant by the simplify brix scale but even today there be vintner who will use a baum\\u00e3 \\u00a9 measurement to estimate the level of dissolve solid in their grape juice that give they a good idea of the sugar content in the juice and by extension the potential alcohol level in their finish wine if we think of

make by submerge a whole egg in alcohol for about a month over time the ethanol seep through the pore of the shell and coagulate the egg inside effectively cook it with no heat require prepare a baum\\u00e3 \\u00a9 egg feel close to modern molecular gastronomy than simply fry one in a pan but its a bit hard to articulate why after all the change an egg go through when expose to heat be a molecular one too for that matter so be cure meat ferment vegetable and almost every other form of food preparation or preservation human have be practice for millennia this make molecular gastronomy tricky to define herv\\u00e3 \\u00a9 this be a scientist and magazine editor and one of the pioneer in the field he distinguish between molecular cookery and molecular gastronomy in his understanding molecular cookery involve use new technique and science to make well food and should be consider an art rather than a science molecular gastronomy on the other hand be the scientific discipline of understanding cook even this admit though that there be not any one universally accept definition of the term when people think of molecular gastronomy today they re usually think of the intersection of food science and even theater that be exemplify at restaurant like el bulli and that have its own antecedent in culinary history french chef and cookbook author marieantoine car\\u00e3\\u00aame become famous for experiment with a presentationforward cooking style in the early 19th century it do not feature the chemical wizardry that s essential to modern molecular gastronomy today but it do bring together art and science in the form of edible architecture creation he s credit with like the choux pastry puff tower know as croquembouche be mean to be a feast for the eye as well as the palate car\\u00e3\\u00aame construct other centerpiece dessert to resemble ancient structure like temple and pyramid he sum up his attitude in one of his cookbook I want order and taste a welldisplaye meal be enhance one hundred percent in my eye the haute cuisine pioneer by car\\u00e3\\u00aame be a hit in the dining room of the wealthy but he do not intend for his style of cook to be exclusive in the several cookbook he author in his lifetime he share instruction for pull off complicated cooking technique in a home kitchen accord to eater car\\u00e3\\u00aame be the first cookbook to use the phrase you can try this for yourself at home car\\u00e3\\u00aame may have inadvertently lay the groundwork for one strand of what would become molecular gastronomy but it would take a long time for the term itself to arise in 1988 cooking school instructor elizabeth cawdry thomas and physics professor ugo valdr\\u00e3\\u00a8 meet in italy and agree on the potential value of a workshop focus on the science of food at that time new scientific advancement in the culinary art be generally the domain of industrial food manufacturer they be not view as tool for home or restaurant chef the idea spark by cawdry thomas eventually become the erice workshop which begin in sicily in 1992 this be where the term molecular gastronomy first appear publicly accord to dr harold mcgee who eventually become one of the workshop coorganizer the original poster publicize the event advertise an international workshop on molecular and physical gastronomy but the blend of science and cooking discuss at these conference be different from the theatrical innovative style of fine dining that rise to prominence in the come year the purpose be really to understand traditional cooking the science of food that have be traditionally prepare in restaurant and be consider the height of the art of cooking mcgee tell as for why the word molecular be choose in the first place it be all about time molecular biology be a trendy field in the early 1990 even people outside the scientific community be hear about it cawdry thomas recruit oxford physicist nicholas kurti to be the workshop director herv\\u00e3 \\u00a9 this also sign on cawdry thomass contribution do not stop at the conception stage once the event be up and run she lead several workshop include a blind tasting of tomato with various kind of salt and another blind tasting compare food prepare in a microwave versus conventional cooking method though she be integral to the endeavor cawdry thomass role have often be overlook with medium highlight this s and kurtis contribution instead there be the professional hierarchy mcgee say you know there be professor of physics and then there be cook school teacher and you know the hierarchy back then and still now I m sure be pretty clear and then also the world of cook back then and the world of science back then and still be dominate by man there be to my recollection no woman cook no woman chef invite to this meeting elizabeth be always there to make thing happen to introduce people to each other just a wonderfully warm welcoming presence I think actually she probably feel more comfortable behind the scene than on stage but that do not excuse the fact that all along her contribution be really neglect I do not think the workshop would have take place without she the goal of that initial workshop be to bring together chef writer and scientist to discuss four area of interest what be already understand about the science of cook how a well understanding of science could improve exist cooking method the benefit of develop new kind of cooking technique and ingredient and whether approach use in industrial food processing could be adapt to small kitchen though these summit be sometimes think of as the birthplace of modern molecular gastronomy they be not a forum for chef to brainstorm whimsical dish for 300 taste menus rather the participant be more concerned with the practical application of science on the broad culinary scene around the same time as the erice workshop ferran adri\\u00e3xa0 be pioneer the foam and eyedropper style of cooking that s more commonly think of as molecular gastronomy today what we be do in the erice meeting be along the same line you know part of the zeitgeist in the culinary world classic french cooking that then become standard international hotel cooking be you just follow a book the escoffi playbook mcgee say in the 1960 in france along with nouvelle roman the new novel the new movie and so on there be also a movement for the new cooking nouvelle cuisine I see what happen in spain as kind of the explosive outgrowth of something that really begin in the sixty in france and in particular with this one guy ferran adri\\u00e3 \\u00a1 who be just you know he be the gaud\\u00e3xad of cooking mcgee explain that adri\\u00e3xa0 have a completely new way of think about thing an approach that would in the end really benefit from a scientific understanding of food and cooking which be I think why the science of food and cooking or one of the reason that the science of food and cooking become of such general interest what he have do be take ingredient and completely transform they physically and that just change the experience of eat because you know you look at a leaf of lettuce you know what its go to taste like but you look at a green blob you have no idea until you put it in your mouth those flavor foam make with whip cream canister be so sensational that they lead to a spate of knockoff often perceive to be cover up for subpar cooking in a piece by jeremy repanich for robb report the chef alex stupak liken the use of oncedare technique by less chef to the pyrotechnic at a kiss concert take that away take your face paint away and you suck after take over el bulli as head chef adri\\u00e3xa0 launch his own series of culinary workshop center around develop new menu the restaurant be open for six month out of the year and for the other six month he lead his team of chef in experiment with new cooking technique and translate they into finish dish this combination of meticulous empirical experimentation and total artistic freedom may be at the heart of molecular gastronomy and it lead to el bulli be name good restaurant in the world by restaurant magazine five time throughout the

dufresne and his team pull it off by add gelatin to the sauce so it could be cut into portion and add starch to protect the egg yolk in the hollandaise from high heat thus prevent they from scramble today dufresne passion for tinkering have take he in a seemingly different direction run his own doughnut shop and popup pizzeria in new york city but these humble food be no less the product of food science than noodle make with methylcellulose or indeed pizza pebble a deconstruct dish that be once on the menu of wd50 dufresne even give a lecture at harvard in 2021 about his quest for pizza dough perfection touch on topic like gluten level cold fermentation and manipulate carbon dioxide perhaps the other american chef most commonly associate with molecular cuisine be grant achatz its not hard to see the influence of chemistry in the menu of his chicago restaurant alinea the famous translucent pumpkin pie be make by set concentrated pumpkin pie stock in clear gelatin and perhaps even more so than some of his peer achatz celebrate the artistic side of molecular cooking as well like car\\u00e3\\u00aame two century before he he prioritize serve a welldisplaye meal that take heavy inspiration from the art world a famous dessert course at alinea be literally paint onto the table to resemble an abstract art piece a different dessert feature edible sugar balloon fill with actual helium guest be encourage to inhale call to mind car\\u00e3\\u00aame whimsical pastry tower but crank up to 11 in a 2021 article for insidehook achatz explain the emotional part of molecular gastronomy that balance out the cold science write I like to say that this style of cooking use emotion as season intimidation confusion intrigue happiness magic and nostalgia be layer over delicious food by use newly develop technique idea and equipment to manipulate the food in unexpected way these chef be credit with shape molecular gastronomy but they have not all embrace the label some of they have outright reject it when discuss the phrase heston blumenthal tell the guardian molecular make it sound complicated \\u00e2x80 \\u00a6 and gastronomy make it sound elitist ferran adri\\u00e3xa0 have express similar sentiment and instead refer to his style of cooking as deconstructivist achatz prefer progressive american other name that have be toss around to describe a sciencebase approach to fine dining include avantgarde modernist and experimental cuisine none of these term have succeed in replace molecular gastronomy in the cultural lexicon sure the phrase originate with a workshop that have nothing to do with liquid olive or sugar balloon and maybe the word molecular be both too broad and too specific to describe the cuisine its associate with but its apt in its own way the futuristic name point to the crucial role science play in create deliciousness and to the possibility unlock by experimentation ingredient be physical and chemical material and when we cook we transform they from one state into another mcgee say and those transformation be govern by the law of physics and chemistry so any time you cook an egg you re do physics and chemistry both and the more we understand about what it be be exactly do when we cook in the kitchen the well we can control those process and come up with the result that we want the label may be a little overthetop but in a fun and sometimes frustrating way that be the case with much of the food serve at the most innovative restaurant of the 2000 this story be adapt from an episode of food history on

have ever be discover yet thank to advance in dna analysis scientist have uncover intriguing clue about their life read on for nine fact about the mysterious denisovan today all modern human be homo sapiens but as a specie we have take millennium to evolve the very early human ancestor aka hominin emerge around 7 million year ago while specie in our genus homo begin appear about 23 million year ago within the last 150 year or so scientist have discover evidence for at least eight different hominin in homo from homo erectus the first to migrate out of africa to the tiny homo floresiensis who stand only 3 foot 6 inch tall in 2010 russian scientist michael shunkov and anatoly derevianko unearth a tiny finger bone in the altai mountain in southern siberia the fragment be send to the max planck institute in germany for dna analysis where a team lead by paleogeneticist svante p\\u00e3\\u00a4\\u00e3\\u00a4bo determine that the bone come from an unknown type of archaic human closely relate to both homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis the first bone fragment be find in the denisova cave which lend its name to the mysterious hominin this incredible site be the only place in the world know to have be occupy by more than one hominin group fossil and debris from the many layer of cave floor provide evidence that the cave be inhabit by denisovan roughly 200000 year ago by neanderthal 100000 year ago and by modern human at some point the two group of extinct hominin may have coexist there the denisovan be especially mysterious because archaeologist have uncover so few fossil mean that we do not really know what they look like the only know fossil so far confirm as denisovan include three loose tooth a skull fragment a finger bone half of a break jawbone and four other small sliver of bone the remain be identify as denisovan by protein or dna analysis rather than morphology and fascinating question about the physical characteristic of these ancient human ancestor be still to be answer scientist continue to search for more denisovan bone fossil find in china taiwan and kyrgyzstan be think to be likely contender however their poor quality have preclude any dna extraction and analysis at this stage its unclear if they be denisovan or belong to another hominin group the denisovan be the only hominin identify as distinct from other hominin by dna alone because so few of their fossil have be find and because the one we have be mere fragment scientist have not determine the anatomy of a denisovan without the physical description they can not be confirm as a new specie or subspecie for now denisovan be consider a population in the genus homo researcher look at human evolution have suggest that the human ancestor homo heidelbergensis which live between 600000 and 300000 year ago leave africa about 400000 year ago some move west into europe and likely evolve into neanderthal while other travel into central asia and become the denisovan hominin group that remain in africa evolve into homo sapiens by 60000 year ago this group have also migrate into europe and asia and live alongside neanderthal and denisovan for several thousand year in 2018 analysis of a bone fragment find in siberia reveal that it come from a teenage girl with a neanderthal mother and a denisovan father provide the only know evidence of a firstgeneration hybrid hominin the girl nickname denny be think to have live 90000 year ago dna evidence show that denisovan neanderthal and modern human be relate closely enough that they could interbreed and bear child and that neanderthal and denisovan be more closely related to each other than to homo sapiens the fossilize remain of denisovan come from just two location siberia and tibet though a tooth find in laos may also be denisovan their genetic legacy however suggest they inhabit large swath of asia dna analysis of modern human in southeast asia show that many people have trace of denisovan dna suggest modern human in the region interbreed with denisovan many thousand of year ago and indicate that they live much far south than have be initially think genetic evidence from papua new guinea hint that some modern human may have interbreed with denisovan as recently as 25000 year ago imply that homo sapiens and denisovan coexist in these area for thousand of year today the indigenous ayta magbukon people in the philippine modern new guinean and aboriginal australian may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their gene to denisovan dna the denisovan live harsh environment from the cold frozen steppe of siberia to the high altitude of tibet the excavation in laos also suggest that some denisovan community live in the lush tropical woodland of southeast asia the variety of the denisovans habitat imply that they readily adapt to the climate in which they migrate and settle in fact scientist work in tibet find that modern tibetan may have inherit a denisovan gene that help they adapt to the lowoxygen environment at high altitude some scientist suggest that denisovan go extinct as recently as 20000 year ago they may have die out due to extensive interbreed with other hominin mean that they slowly became absorb into the wide human population its also possible that as homo sapiens encroach on denisovan habitat they outcompete they for food or introduce deadly disease that contribute to the denisovan demise in the future if more denisovan remain be identify archaeologist may be able to discover more answer to these elusive early hominin read more story

seem like it would apply to major surgery for a handful of people however the notion of cut themselves open to relieve a condition seem like a good idea or their only option take a look at some of historys autosurgical pioneer in april 1961 leonid rogozov find himself in a bit of a pickle the 27yearold surgeon be part of a soviet expedition to antarctica when he get sick with what he eventually realize be appendicitis there be no other doctor on the expedition the weather make fly anywhere impossible not to mention the fact that travel back to russia by sea take almost 40 day so rogozov who write in his journal that the pain feel like a snowstorm whip through my soul wail like a hundred jackal decide that the only option he have if he want to live be to take a scalpel to himself what do you do if you re stuck in antarctica and you need to operate on yourself rogozov first get the necessary permission all the way from moscow then enlist three of his colleague to be his assistant during the surgery they would hand he the instrument he need and hold a mirror so he could see what he be do he instruct they to inject he with adrenaline if he pass out and even tell they to perform artificial ventilation if necessary then he inject novocaine into his abdomen and get to work he later write that although he be terrify somehow I automatically switch into operating mode and from that point on I do not notice anything else the surgery be not easy rogozov have to discard the mirror and work by touch but the surgeon do eventually reach his appendix remove it and stitch himself up in around two hour good thing too after look at the organ he estimate it would have burst within a day rogozov go back to work two week later some country like australia have since mandate that physician head for the antarctic have their appendix remove via elective surgery before travel there rogozov be not the only person to have take out their own appendix there s also the australian veterinary surgeon robert kerr mclaren who remove the organ in a jungle in the philippine san anesthesia in the 1940 and dr evan kane who well get to later in this list you might not know gouverneur morriss name but you ve probably read his work he tweak some of the language of the constitution earn himself the moniker the penman of the constitution he be also a us senator and a onetime minister to france and have the dubious distinction of be the only found father to stick whalebone in his penis at least that we know about here what happen in 1816 morriss health be on the decline in addition to have a rage case of gout he be also have trouble urinate possibly due to a urinary tract infection he be unable to pee and be understandably probably freak out so he decide to grab a piece of whalebone that may have come from his wife corset and stick it up there in an attempt to clear the blockage he have maybe do it once before with a piece of flexible hickory and it have work like a charm so he likely have reasonable confidence that this too would be successful it be not morris end up with a penile infection and die on november 6 1816 in 2003 27yearold climber aron ralston be

whole other form of torture surgeon would stick a finger in the patient rectum to locate the bladder then go through the perineum you know that stretch between the genital and the anus to make a small

anything up the procedure know as a lithotomy be notorious for its high mortality rate and rather than sit for another horrific operation surgeon charlesauguste clever de maldigny who d have many round of bladder stone before opt to relieve his agony himself with the help of a mirror he slice into his bladder and pull out a stone that have apparently form around a surgical sponge leave in

and lonely he get strange idea and one day I tell the nurse that I want to have those toe off she agree that that be good and volunteer to bite his toe off at the joint which freuchen explain would prevent the ghost from occupy my body because her mouth would close the wound immediately he thank she but go with his own toe removal method instead he put a nail puller over each toe and in his word bang it off with a hammer he would eventually lose his whole leg after this incident but that do not slow he down at all freuchen be part of the danish resistance movement against the nazi and aid

he get to work it turn out that puncture the abscess be not the issue the real danger come from the fact that yazykov experience heavy bleeding partly due to some aspirin he have take that thin his blood he make a tourniquet from bungee cord to stop the bleeding at one point but that could have potentially make matter bad if the communication do not go offline carlin would have tell he the tourniquet be just go to cut the blood supply off to his arm completely and cause he to lose it when the communication be back up carlin instruct he to instead apply direct pressure to the wound to

and the drug kick in he sit upright and cut into himself ultimately perform an hourlong surgery twelve day later he be back at work finally let head to germany in 1929 where dr werner theodor otto
