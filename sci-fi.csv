0,"Rock Gardens Contradict Easter Island âEcocideâ Theory, Study Finds","['science', 'history', 'archaeology', 'mystery', 'news', 'origins', '2024SEOnew']","['When British explorer James Cook arrived at Rapa Nui â\x80\x94 known to him as Easter Island â\x80\x94 in 1774, he described small bands of malnourished people barely sustained by a barren, treeless strip of rock in the Pacific Ocean. â\x80\x9cNature has been exceedingly sparing of her favours to this spot,â\x80\x9d he wrote. Yet, Cook had gone there to obtain supplies and to see marvels described by the two previous European expeditions to the island, the towering stone statues with oversized heads known as moai.Â\xa0', 'Rapa Nui presented an archeological mystery: The moai stand as high as 33 feet, weigh about 14 tons each, and were transported for display around the island. How did people on the remote volcanic outcrop, where day-to-day survival was a challenge, produce more than 900 of them? It seemed an almost impossible feat for a society separated from global technological development, 2300 kilometers from the nearest continent.', 'Some scholars have suggested a narrative of ecocide: Sometime before first contact with Europeans, a thriving Rapanui civilization rapidly consumed the islandâ\x80\x99s limited natural resourcesâ\x80\x94explaining the lack of treesâ\x80\x94perhaps to sustain the operation that created the moai. This, scholars say, led to a societal collapse that depopulated Rapa Nui and hastened its ruin before the European diseases and raids by Peruvian enslavers that decimated the islandâ\x80\x99s people in the 19th century.Â\xa0', 'New research from Binghamton University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, and other institutions casts doubts on the ecocide story. Researchers say that a survey of ancient rock gardens using satellite imagery indicates that Rapa Nui never had a population much larger than it did when a Dutch sailing crew became the first Europeans to reach the island in 1722.', 'To understand their conclusion, you might need a crash course in agriculture on volcanic islands. The first settlers arrived on Rapa Nui sometime before 800 CE. Farming conditions were harsh, and the population relied on a â\x80\x9csoilâ\x80\x9d of plant waste and rock mulch to grow root vegetables.Â\xa0', 'Rapa Nui is about 40,500 acres, a little smaller than the land area of Washington, D.C. Determining how much of it was used for rock gardens is a way to estimate its peak population, and past scholars came up with ranges. A 2012 study by the University of Auckland used weaker satellite data and estimated between 2.5 and 12.7 percent of the island. The paper admitted that some areas could have been roads or other structures. But this earlier research left open the possibility that Rapa Nuiâ\x80\x99s peak population was as high as 17,000â\x80\x94which could support the theory that ecocide reduced the population to the 3000 people whom archeologists agree were on the island at the time of first contact.', 'The authors of the new paper, published in Science Advances, used satellite data that could detect moisture and soil components and claim that only 180 acresâ\x80\x94or 0.4 percent of the islandâ\x80\x94was used for rock gardening. This would have supported only about 3000 people, perpetually.Â\xa0', 'The ecocide theory was first proposed in the early 1990s and popularized in historian Jared Diamondâ\x80\x99s 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed [PDF]. It seemed like a perfect cautionary tale for a world on the brink of climate change: A proud society capable of producing art and engineering wonders over-harvesting itself to a state of scarcity and tribal warfare. As Diamond wrote, â\x80\x9cWhat did the Easter Islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it? Like modern loggers, did he shout, â\x80\x98Jobs, not trees!?â\x80\x99', 'Several archeologists and other researchers pushed back, citing radiocarbon dating and other methods of tracking human activity, to argue that the population of Rapa Nui grew or remained stable until first contact. Some of their evidence suggested the island had been deforested for as long as humans had lived on it. (One theory supposes that a breed of rat that came over with the first settlers destroyed the forests and native fauna.)Â\xa0', 'Some argue the ecocide theory paints the Rapanui people as ignorant and diminishes the impact of colonialism on their history. One prominent anthropologist wrote that it â\x80\x9cturned the victims of cultural and physical extermination into the perpetrators of their own demise.â\x80\x9d Now, with new scientific evidence, that narrative is changing.', 'Read More Stories About Archaeology:', 'manual', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/easter-island-study-contradicts-ecocide

2,The Grisly 1924 Crime That Led to the Forensic âMurder Bagâ,"['history', 'crime', 'murder', '2024SEOnew']","['In the United States, the term murder bag has been used to describe a collection of tools a killer might use to stalk, subdue, and attack a victim. In the UK, though, the term has a very different connotation: It refers to the iconic toolkits used by 20th-century Scotland Yard investigators to process the scenes of violent crimes.', 'The murder bag provided detectives with the equipment they needed to find, document, and collect evidence, including a magnifying glass, measuring devices, swabs, sample bags, scissors, and tweezers. But the reason anyone thought to assemble the bags in the first place was to equip them with something a little less glamorous: rubber gloves. And if you think gloves arenâ\x80\x99t an indispensable part of an investigatorâ\x80\x99s tool bag, you obviously werenâ\x80\x99t on scene to deal with the aftermath of the 1924 murder of Emily Kayeâ\x80\x94the gruesome crime that spurred the creation of the murder bag and changed the course of forensic science.', 'In May 1924, Patrick Mahon was arrested at Londonâ\x80\x99s Waterloo train station when he tried to retrieve a bag heâ\x80\x99d left there earlier. Unbeknownst to Mahon, the bag had been found and examined by a private detective hired by Mahonâ\x80\x99s wife, whoâ\x80\x99d discovered a luggage claim ticket while searching for some clue as to her husbandâ\x80\x99s whereabouts. The detective had alerted Scotland Yard about what he found in the bag: a large knife and bloodied clothing. Police were eager to discuss those items with Mahon.', 'Once he was in custody, it didnâ\x80\x99t take long for Mahon to direct authorities to a bungalow heâ\x80\x99d shared with his mistress, Emily Kaye. Mahon claimed Kaye had thrown an axe at him during a heated argument, then died after falling and hitting her head on a coal bucket. According to Mahon, he had panicked and spent the next several days attempting to obliterate the body of the woman he definitely didnâ\x80\x99t murder.', 'Police wasted no time in summoning the recently knighted Sir Bernard Spilsbury to the scene of the crime. Spilsbury was a pathologist whose testimony had been crucial in the 1910 trial of Hawley Crippen, an American doctor who was convicted of murdering and dismembering his wife. Spilsburyâ\x80\x99s role in the case, and his work on subsequent, high-profile murder investigations, had made him a celebrity in the waning years of what George Orwell called Englandâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cgreat period in murderâ\x80\x9d: a 75-year stretch when the country seemed to bounce from one sensational murder trial to the next.', 'Even an investigator as seasoned as Spilsbury must have been horrified by the scene that awaited him. According to Colin Evansâ\x80\x99s 2006 book The Father of Forensics, Mahon had dismembered Kayeâ\x80\x99s body and attempted to dispose of the pieces by boiling, burning, or squirreling them away throughout the bungalow. In the living room area, police found fragments of bone in the fireplace and a piece of flesh in a large pot on the hearth. In a bedroom, they found more of Kayeâ\x80\x99s remains stuffed in a trunk, a hatbox, and a cookie tin.', 'Spilsbury set up an impromptu laboratory in the bungalowâ\x80\x99s courtyard to process evidence, requesting that Kayeâ\x80\x99s remains be brought out to the makeshift facility. Apparently without giving it a second thought, the officers proceeded to fill buckets with the decomposing body partsâ\x80\x94using their bare hands. â\x80\x9cAre there no gloves?â\x80\x9d an appalled Spilsbury asked Chief Inspector Percy Savage, who told him his men never wore gloves or any other type of personal protective equipment.', 'The pathologist was initially mortified about the potential for infection, but he later learned that the officers tasked with processing crime scenes were fundamentally underequipped for their work. Forget essential hygiene and sanitation suppliesâ\x80\x94they didnâ\x80\x99t even have tape measures, tweezers, or tools for collecting fingerprints. (The UK had been using fingerprint evidence to investigate and prosecute crimes for more than 20 years by then.)', 'Spilsbury enlisted the aid of Savage, a police surgeon named Aubrey Scott-Gillett, and Scotland Yardâ\x80\x99s Detective Superintendent William Brown to assemble the worldâ\x80\x99s first known â\x80\x9cmurder bag.â\x80\x9d', 'The contents of a murder bag might seem like common sense to anyone whoâ\x80\x99s ever seen an episode of CSI, but they were novel enough to receive widespread press coverage in the 1920s. A short item in a 1927 edition of The New York Times announced that Scotland Yard had acquired five new murder bags and catalogued their contents, which included measuring devices, magnifying glasses, a flashlight, test tubes, tweezers, handcuffs, and â\x80\x9ccomplete finger-printing apparatus,â\x80\x9d along with a few items that must have made Spilsburyâ\x80\x99s heart sing. Besides his beloved rubber gloves (two pairs!), investigators would also have a rubber apron, disinfectant in both topical and tablet form, and a bar of soap (though this was mainly used to take impressions of small objects found at a crime scene).', 'The murder bag continued to evolve over the years, with Scotland Yard increasing its inventory of bags and expanding their contents as needed. There were six murder bags on hand by 1930, with each now including zinc molds for preserving footprints. By 1955, the inventory stood at eight bags. In 1957, a widely published wire story reported that Londoners were so busy killing each other that Scotland Yard was running out of murder bags. That same year, the kits became even further embedded in British culture with the premiere of Murder Bag, a half-hour crime drama that ran until 1959 before morphing into Crime Sheet and, later, No Hiding Place.', 'Murder bags in their original form have since been relegated to history books and crime museums, but their spirit lives on in the form of modern forensics kitsâ\x80\x94which, Spilsbury would be glad to know, include gloves, facemasks, and other personal protective equipment.', 'Read More About True Crime:', 'manual', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/forensic-kit-murder-bag-origins
3,12 Stunning Facts About Solar Storms,"['space', 'weather', 'science']","['A solar storm struck Earth in May 2024, delivering dazzling northern lights to places we donâ\x80\x99t typically see themâ\x80\x94as far south as Oklahoma and Florida. It was the most intense storm in two decades and the largest display of aurorae in 500 yearsâ\x80\x94and we still havenâ\x80\x99t reached the peak of the current activity cycle (thatâ\x80\x99s in 2025).Â\xa0', ""The sunâ\x80\x99s constant magnetic activity builds over an average 11-year cycle; at the end of the process, eruptions of energy unleash charged particles that rush along solar winds and collide with Earth's magnetic field. While the northern and southern lights are amazing to behold and pose little direct danger to humans, a strong solar storm can have dire consequences for our technological systems, including power, navigation, communications, and more."", 'Here are 12 facts related to solar stormsâ\x80\x94how they happen, what they wreak, and when theyâ\x80\x99ll be back.Â\xa0', 'The sun is a giant ball of always-active gases. Occasionally, the magnetic turbulence within the sun creates dark, planet-sized regions on the surfaceâ\x80\x94a.k.a. sunspotsâ\x80\x94that are capable of causing solar flares (massive eruptions of radiation) or coronal mass ejections (or CMEs, which are explosions of plasma from the sunâ\x80\x99s interior).', 'Sunspots appear darker in contrast to the rest of the sun because theyâ\x80\x99re cooler than the surrounding mass. A typical sunspot on its own would be about as bright as Earthâ\x80\x99s moon. Each sunspot has a dark, central area (umbra), which is roughly 6300Â°F compared with the rest of the sunâ\x80\x99s photosphere at 10,000Â°F. The boiling hotbed of magnetic activity within the sunspot causes its pressure to increase, which prevents interior heated gas from rising to the surface and further lowers the sunspotâ\x80\x99s temperature. When the pressure becomes too great, a solar flare might erupt and a CME may explode, shooting charged particles outward that typically take three to five days to reach Earth.', 'The sun sends Earth space weather in three forms: a radio blackout, a solar radiation storm, or the strongest of all, a geomagnetic storm. A radio blackout, caused by eruptions of radiation from solar flares, is the most common and occurs approximately 2000 times per solar cycle. These storms also reach Earth quickest, making them hard to plan for; their effects are less severe and more limited to issues with aviation and marine equipment. A solar radiation storm involves a significant number of energized protons, which may reach Earth in as quickly as 10 minutes. Radiation near Earth then increases to dangerous levels, posing a health risk to astronauts and potentially disrupting satellite electronics from hours to days. Geomagnetic storms are the most powerful, and theyâ\x80\x99re also the most noticeableâ\x80\x94producing colorful aurorae and causing electronic systems to go haywire (which is why theyâ\x80\x99re the focus of this list).', 'In 1957, University of Chicago astrophysicist Eugene Parker theorized that the sun must emit charged particles from its corona, wherein the corona becomes so hot that the particles eventually escape the sunâ\x80\x99s gravity. Though widely criticized at the time, Parkerâ\x80\x99s description of solar wind was accurate: Itâ\x80\x99s plasma containing protons and electrons that soars away from the sun continuously, yet remains within a protected bubble that encapsulates the entire solar system called the â\x80\x9cheliosphere.â\x80\x9d The winds that form this windsock-shaped bubble protect us from dangerous cosmic rays, but theyâ\x80\x99re also what carry a geomagnetic storm toward Earth. As NASA associate administrator Nicky Fox once poetically put it, â\x80\x9cif the sun sneezes, Earth catches a cold.â\x80\x9d', 'Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland was the first to offer a scientific explanation for aurorae as a product of geomagnetism in 1906. It wasnâ\x80\x99t until the 1970s and the advent of satellite technology that his theory could be confirmed correct.', 'Different areas of the sun produce solar wind at speeds that range from 250 to 500 miles per second, faster at the Sunâ\x80\x99s poles versus its equator, which determine how quickly a solar storm reaches Earth (it can take from 15 hours to several days). Earthâ\x80\x99s magnetosphere deflects most of the charged particles brought by the constant solar wind. However, when a substantial CME occurs, the material that reaches Earth contains its own magnetic field. This field makes contact with Earthâ\x80\x99s geomagnetic field, causing changes in the upper atmosphere (roughly 53â\x80\x93375 miles above our planet) and creating a complex undulation of electrical currents.Â\xa0', 'Protons and radiation rain along our planetâ\x80\x99s magnetic field lines, which send the stream of particles toward Earthâ\x80\x99s north and south poles. There, the material collides with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which fuel the particles with energy and make them glow as northern or southern lights.Â\xa0', 'Galileo described the lights and named them aurora borealis in his Discourse on the Comets, published in 1619. Combining the Latin word for â\x80\x9cdawnâ\x80\x9d and the Greek word for â\x80\x9cnorth,â\x80\x9d Galileo wrote, â\x80\x9cthe sky at nighttime [is] illuminated in its northern parts in such a way that its brightness yields nothing to the brightest dawn and closely rivals the sun â\x80¦ forming for us this northern dawn [questa boreale aurora]â\x80\x9d [PDF]. The French astronomer and mathematician Pierre Gassendi witnessed a display of the aurora borealis in France in 1621, but did not use the phrase in writing until 1649. The first appearance of aurora borealis in English occurred in a letter written by John Flamsteed, Britainâ\x80\x99s astronomer royal, in 1703.', 'Seventy years later, Captain James Cook became the first to describe the aurora australis, or southern lights, on his trip around the tip of South America.Â\xa0', 'Aurorae colors are different in the two hemispheres. Northern lights tend to show greener and whiter shades, and southern lights feature mostly green and pink. Blues, reds, and purples make a cameo at both poles. There are also reports that aurorae emit soundâ\x80\x94often a hissing, crackling noise. NASA wants aurora fans to track their sightings on Aurorasaurus, a citizen science database, because each verified sighting contributes to better modeling of the marvels.', 'The intense bombardment of electromagnetic particles in a geomagnetic storm can shove a satellite out of orbit, undermine undersea cables transmitting the internet, take down power grids, disrupt circuits and signals, and more. A 1989 storm led to a 12-hour electrical event in Quebec, casting more than 6 million people into the dark.Â\xa0', 'Ocean monitoring systems are also at risk. Comprised of thousands of sensors that span the Arctic to Antarctic, these observatories measure ocean currents and record climate data. In May 2024, ocean-borne compasses captured significant swings related to the messy magnetic field. Many shared GPS outages on social media during the solar storm, and one South Dakota farmer described his GPS-powered tractor as uncontrollable and moving in circles.Â\xa0', 'NASAâ\x80\x99s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was created in 2010 to understand the sunâ\x80\x99s behavior better. A solar flare can be billions of times more powerful than a single nuclear bomb, with the strongest flares (X-class) occurring about 10 times each year. The biggest CME may house billions of tons of powerful solar stuff that gets blown our way. As it monitors solar activity, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ranks incoming geomagnetic storms as G1 (minor), G2 (moderate), G3 (strong), G4 (severe), or G5 (extreme). To determine their severity, NOAA measures multiple currentsâ\x80\x94some circling Earth, some produced in the magnetosphere, and other within auroraeâ\x80\x94along with magnetic disturbances on the ground. A solar storm can run for hours or days, with impacts lasting for weeks.Â\xa0', 'The Carrington Event was an extreme geomagnetic storm that struck Earth in early September 1859. Though many skywatchers were gazing upward at increasing sunspot activity, amateur astronomer Richard Carrington, stationed in Surrey, England, spotted a sudden flash of brilliant light that he considered to be the cause of the resulting catastrophe.Â\xa0', 'In fewer than 20 hours, a CME traveled 90 million miles and arrived at Earth in the form of an incredibly powerful solar storm. The event was unprecedented: Nearly all of the worldâ\x80\x99s 125,000 miles of telegraph lines were affected, with outages lasting eight hours in some areas. The telegraph machines shocked their operators and ignited paper, while other equipment ran on ambient energy, even with their batteries disconnected. Aurorae lit up the sky almost as far south as the equator. For the first time, scientists began to see the relationship between the sun and geomagnetic storms, as well as the effects of those storms on modern technology.Â\xa0', 'If a solar storm on the same scale as the Carrington Event were to happen again, many predict an internet-wide crash, halting online commerce and operations. Researchers have estimated that economic damages could tally up to $2.6 trillion just in the U.S.', 'Everything in spaceâ\x80\x94systems, crafts, humansâ\x80\x94is susceptible to the damage brought by a solar storm. Astronauts above Earthâ\x80\x99s atmosphere need a protective shield to avoid health risks from radiation, for example. Other planets, especially the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, have strong magnetic fields that interact with solar particles and allow them to experience aurorae.Â\xa0', 'In contrast, scientists think solar storms stripped Mars of its atmosphere. Its former oceans, seas, and rivers were protected by a thick atmospheric blanket wrapped around the planet, but modern Mars has an atmosphere thatâ\x80\x99s just 1 percent as dense as Earthâ\x80\x99s. One theory to explain this suggests that approximately 3.7 billion years ago, Marsâ\x80\x99s core cooled, which weakened its magnetic power and made it more susceptible to solar storms.Â\xa0', 'NASAâ\x80\x99s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter was present for a CME that clocked the planet in 2015. It observed that Marsâ\x80\x99s sparse remaining atmosphere vaporized about 10 times faster than normal during the CME, suggesting that this was the likely mechanism behind its loss of atmosphere over time.', 'A 2022 study published in Nature Communications reported that ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica contained an abnormal abundance of solar energetic particles, evidence that points to a massive solar storm affecting Earth about 9200 years ago. And, from analysis of carbon-14 in tree rings, NASA proposed that a solar storm with a similar severity to Carrington hit Earth in 774 CE.Â\xa0', 'The earliest known written description of aurorae comes from China in 2600 BCE. Aristotle also wrote about aurorae roughly 2000 years ago.', 'Researchers have theorized that prehistoric rock art containing seemingly abstract shapes and lines may actually depict atmospheric phenomena, particularly aurorae, and may have spiritual meaning. Vikings thought an aurora meant Odin, the Norse god of death and war, had sent the Valkyries to take fallen warriors to Valhalla. Cree people saw aurorae as spirits communicating with their living loved ones. Finnish beliefs held that an aurora resulted from a â\x80\x9cfire foxâ\x80\x9d sprinting across the snow and spraying sparks across the dark sky (the Finnish word for aurora, revontulet, means â\x80\x9cfire foxâ\x80\x9d).', 'NOAAâ\x80\x99s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is constantly supervising the skies from its base in Colorado. Telescopes on the ground and above Earth keep an active eye out for variations in space between the sun and Earth that could indicate solar storms brewing. This early warning system was critical for protecting sensitive equipment prior to the May 2024 event, and itâ\x80\x99s a key to preventing future damage as we progress through the 11-year sunspot cycles.Â\xa0', 'Monitoring of sunspot cycles began in 1755 with Solar Cycle 1. Today, weâ\x80\x99re in the midst of Solar Cycle 25, which the National Weather Service predicts will peak in July 2025 with 115 sunspots.

Birds possess extraordinary intelligence, and crows, in particular, have demonstrated keen abilities that continue to surprise researchers. The latest discovery: carrion crows can count out loud.', 'In a paper [PDF] published in the journal Science, researchers at the University of Tubingen in Germany recruited three Corvus corone subjects to analyze whether they could comprehend and vocalize numerical values in objects and sounds. The crows responded to these cues with anywhere from one to four â\x80\x9ccaws.â\x80\x9d Itâ\x80\x99s a counting behavior similar to toddlers, in which the human children might single out three LEGO bricks by saying â\x80\x9coneâ\x80\x9d three times, a kind of bridge approach to counting before theyâ\x80\x99re able to count to a total in their heads.', 'The crows were shown a numeral as well as a distinctive sound (like a guitar or drum roll) and were trained to respond to each with a set number of caws. Then, when shown the prompt again, the crows were expected to make the same number of sounds in order to get a reward. The idea was to get the crow to assess how many inflections were needed to reach their goal.', 'The crows performed the task successfully, but researchers were concerned the birds might just be cawing until their treat was delivered. So they added what amounted to a â\x80\x9csubmitâ\x80\x9d button, tasking the crows with pecking it after cawing as a way of saying they were done.', 'In the experiment, the crows demonstrated accuracy above the threshold of mere chance. When they got an answer wrong, it was typically within one caw, meaning the mistake was more likely a lapse in concentration rather than confusion.', 'But isnâ\x80\x99t it possible the crows are simply mimicking the desired sound without truly understanding numbers? Researchers also observed a kind of tell: When more caws were expected, the crows hesitated before vocalizing, signaling they had to weigh the number needed.', 'In the past, crows have displayed abilities ranging from recognizing traffic lights to human faces. New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) can even craft simple toolsâ\x80\x94a tiny hook made from a twig that helps root out insects from crevices.', 'Proportionally, their brains are significantly larger than their interrogatorsâ\x80\x99 at an average of 2.7 percent of its body weight compared to 1.9 percent for humans.

The weather made flying anywhere impossible, not to mention the fact that travel back to Russia by sea took almost 40 days.Â\xa0', 'So Rogozovâ\x80\x94who wrote in his journal that the pain felt like â\x80\x9cA snowstorm whipping through my soul, wailing like a hundred jackalsâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94decided that the only option he had if he wanted to live was to take a scalpel to himself.', 'What do you do if youâ\x80\x99re stuck in Antarctica and you need to operate on yourself? Rogozov first got the necessary permission all the way from Moscow, then enlisted three of his colleagues to be his assistants during the surgery. They would hand him the instruments he needed and hold a mirror so he could see what he was doing. He instructed them to inject him with adrenaline if he passed out and even told them to perform artificial ventilation if necessary. Then he injected novocaine into his abdomen and got to workâ\x80\x94heÂ\xa0 later wrote that although he was terrified, â\x80\x9csomehow I automatically switched into operating mode, and from that point on I didnâ\x80\x99t notice anything else.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0Â\xa0', 'The surgery was not easyâ\x80\x94Rogozov had to discard the mirror and work by touchâ\x80\x94but the surgeon did eventually reach his appendix, remove it, and stitch himself up in around two hours. Good thing, too; after looking at the organ, he estimated it would have burst within a day.Â\xa0 Rogozov went back to work two weeks later.', 'Some countries, like Australia, have since mandated that physicians headed for the Antarctic have their appendix removed via elective surgery before traveling there.', 'Rogozov isnâ\x80\x99t the only person to have taken out their own appendix. Thereâ\x80\x99s also the Australian veterinary surgeon Robert Kerr McLaren, who removed the organ in a jungle in the Philippines sans anesthesia in the 1940s, and Dr. Evan Kane, who weâ\x80\x99ll get to later in this list.', 'You might not know Gouverneur Morrisâ\x80\x99s name, but youâ\x80\x99ve probably read his work: He tweaked some of the language of the Constitution, earning himself the moniker â\x80\x9cThe Penman of the Constitution.â\x80\x9d He was also a U.S. senator and a one-time minister to France, and has the dubious distinction of being the only Founding Father to stick whalebone in his penis (at least that we know about).', 'Hereâ\x80\x99s what happened: In 1816, Morrisâ\x80\x99s health was on the decline. In addition to having a raging case of gout, he was also having trouble urinating, possibly due to a urinary tract infection. He was unable to pee and was, understandably, probably freaking out. So he decided to grab a piece of whalebone that may have come from his wifeâ\x80\x99s corset and stick it up there in an attempt to clear the blockage. He had maybe done it once before with a piece of flexible hickory, and it had worked like a charmâ\x80\x94so he likely had reasonable confidence that this, too, would be successful.', 'It wasnâ\x80\x99t. Morris ended up with a penile infection and died on November 6, 1816.', 'In 2003, 27-year-old climber Aron Ralston was exploring a canyon in Utah when a boulder dislodged itself and trapped his right arm to the wall. With no phone receptionâ\x80\x94and no phoneâ\x80\x94and precious little to eat or drink, he decided to take the matter into his one free hand and slowly sever his trapped arm using a pocket knife. He was forced to bend and break his bones to complete the job; decomposition gases hissed from his wounds as he sliced.', ""â\x80\x9cThe detachment had already happened in my mind,â\x80\x9d he told The Guardian in 2010. â\x80\x9cIt's rubbish, it's going to kill you, get rid of it Aron. It's an â\x80\x98it.â\x80\x99 Itâ\x80\x99s no longer my arm. As I picked up the knife, I was very cool and collected.â\x80\x9d"", 'Once the arm was cut, Ralston used his climbing gear as a tourniquet and climbed the 65 feet up and out of the canyon.', 'The harrowing experience, which Ralston survived, became the subject of the 2010 movie 127 Hours, named for the amount of time Ralston was stuck under the boulder before he managed to free himself.', 'Bladder stones are horrifically painful, and just a few hundred years ago, the surgery to remove them sounds like a whole other form of torture: Surgeons would stick a finger in the patientâ\x80\x99s rectum to locate the bladder, then go through the perineumâ\x80\x94you know, that stretch between the genitals and the anusâ\x80\x94to make a small incision in the organ. Next theyâ\x80\x99d use forceps or something called a â\x80\x9cscoop extractorâ\x80\x9d to remove the stones. After that theyâ\x80\x99d apparently just â\x80¦ let the wounds heal all on their own. No sewing anything up.', 'The procedure, known as a lithotomy, was notorious for its high mortality rate. And rather than sit for another horrific operation, surgeon Charles-Auguste Clever de Maldignyâ\x80\x94whoâ\x80\x99d had many rounds of bladder stones beforeâ\x80\x94opted to relieve his agony himself.', 'With the help of a mirror, he sliced into his bladder and pulled out a stone that had apparently formed around a surgical sponge left in during one of the previous operations. And he didnâ\x80\x99t die! But he also didnâ\x80\x99t get rid of his bladder stones forever: When they returned years later, de Maldigny opted to have someone else remove them using a new, and less invasive, procedure called a â\x80\x9clithotrity.â\x80\x9d', 'While working on his farm near Pender, Nebraska, in 2019, 63-year-old Kurtis Kaser accidentally got his leg caught in a grain auger. The device began to consume his left foot and threatened to mutilate more of him if he didnâ\x80\x99t act quickly. Kaser used his pocket knife to cut off the remains of his leg, then crawled on his elbows for hundreds of feet to get to a phone. At the hospital, the staff performed a â\x80\x9ccleanâ\x80\x9d amputation between his knee and ankle.

The labor was difficult and Perez had previously had a stillbirthâ\x80\x94so after 12 hours with no baby, she took some shots of hard liquor, and used a 6-inch knife to cut the baby out. They both survived.Â\xa0', 'There were reportedly no witnesses to the actual surgery, but one of the doctors who examined Perez 12 hours after the birth said that â\x80\x9cit was evident this surgery was not done by anyone with medical knowledge.

In a sense itâ\x80\x99s quite satisfying that one can overcome oneâ\x80\x99s nerves to do it.â\x80\x9d Feilding would later undergo trepanation a second time, albeit with someone else doing the drilling.', 'Legendary Danish explorer Peter Freuchen was made of tough stuff: In the 1920s, he returned to an Arctic base from out on the tundra, where he had survived an intense snow storm. His left foot was in bad shape. Gangrene began to develop; Freuchen wrote that â\x80\x9cthe flesh fell away until the bones protruded.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'There were no doctors on site, but Freuchen was attended to by an Indigenous woman who said she had experience with frozen limbs. He would later write that â\x80\x9cWhen a man is sick and cold and lonely he gets strange ideas, and one day I told the nurse that I wanted to have those toes off.â\x80\x9d She agreed that that was best, and volunteered to bite his toes off at the joint, which, Freuchen explained, would â\x80\x9cprevent the ghosts from occupying my bodyâ\x80\x9d because â\x80\x9cher mouth would close the wounds immediately.â\x80\x9d He thanked her, but went with his own toe removal method instead: He put a nail puller over each toe and, in his words, â\x80\x9cbanged it off with a hammer.â\x80\x9d', 'He would eventually lose his whole leg after this incident, but that didnâ\x80\x99t slow him down at all: Freuchen was part of the Danish resistance movement against the Nazis and aided Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. When he was captured by the Nazis and sentenced to death, he escaped. He starred in a movie and won the game show The $64,000 Question.

He arrived for the scheduled surgery to repair a torn ligament in August 2021, but once he was injected with a local anesthetic, he began feeling like his numbed appendage was almost disconnected from the rest of his body. He later told The Cincinnati Enquirer that â\x80\x9cIt really was a lot like it wasnâ\x80\x99t my thumb, it was anybody elseâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x9d and decided to just request a scalpel and operate on himself.

With the emergency tools provided to each competitor by the World Clinic (two scalpels, gloves, iodine, a scrub, and cotton gauze) he got to work.', 'It turned out that puncturing the abscess wasnâ\x80\x99t the issue; the real danger came from the fact that Yazykov experienced heavy bleeding, partly due to someÂ\xa0aspirin he had taken that thinned his blood. He made a tourniquet from bungee cords to stop the bleeding at one point, but that could have potentially made matters worse: If the communications didnâ\x80\x99t go offline, Carlin would have told him the tourniquet was just going to cut the blood supply off to his arm completely and cause him to lose it.', 'When the communication was back up, Carlin instructed him to instead apply direct pressure to the wound to help stop the bleeding. Yazykov wound up recovering and continued on with the race. It may have helped that Yazykov was once a Russian Special Forces commando and prone to keeping his cool in tense situations.', ""Operating on yourself feels like an experience you wouldnâ\x80\x99t want to repeat, but that wasnâ\x80\x99t the case for Dr. Evan O'Neill Kane, a Pennsylvania-based surgeon who, in 1919, amputated his own finger. Then, in 1921, he decided to do a self-surgery for science: Kane was wary of general asthesia, so he tested whether or not local anesthetic would work by giving himself an appendectomy.

When Forssmann offered himself as the patient, the chief refused again; undaunted, Forssmann enlisted a nurse, who volunteered to act as the patient.

Afterward, he apparently walked out to the X-ray department to see if heâ\x80\x99d reached his heart (he hadnâ\x80\x99t, and needed to insert the catheter a little further).

If you didn't like those bugs, you likely wonâ\x80\x99t be thrilled to hear about the latest creepy-crawly invader spreading across the East Coast. As CBS News reports, Joro spiders are already common in the southern U.S., and experts warn itâ\x80\x99s only a matter of time before they invade northeastern states like New York and New Jersey. Whether thatâ\x80\x99s good news or bad news for the local environment remains to be seen. "", ""Joro spiders, or Trichonephila clavata, have spread around the globe from their native home in East Asia. Itâ\x80\x99s unclear how they first landed in the United States, but some experts say they arrived in a shipping container that made its way to Georgia's Interstate 85. Since they were first spotted on U.S. soil in 2013, their populations have exploded."", 'For the most part, theyâ\x80\x99re concentrated in southern states like Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, but theyâ\x80\x99ve been spotted as far north as Ohio. As a 2022 study noted, theyâ\x80\x99re capable of expanding their footprint even farther. Joro spiders have a higher heart rate and metabolism than their relative, the golden silk spider, which has been limited to the South since arriving in the country. Their physiology means theyâ\x80\x99re capable of surviving in northern states where temperatures dip below freezing. They havenâ\x80\x99t been recorded in New York or New Jersey yet, but some experts suspect theyâ\x80\x99ll be making their debut in the area this year.', 'â\x80\x9cAs the Joro spider invasion continues its northward trajectory, the possibility of their arrival in New Jersey later this year has heightened concerns among residents and authorities alike,â\x80\x9d New Jersey Pest Control wrote on its website earlier in 2024. â\x80\x9cThe potential for these spiders to establish populations in new regions raises questions about how local ecosystems will respond and adapt to their presence.â\x80\x9d', 'If you live within their range, the invasive spiders are hard to miss.

After stumbling upon the huge bones in the dirt floor, he reported his discovery to Austriaâ\x80\x99s Federal Monuments Office. The Austrian Archaeological Institute has been excavating the site since March 2024 to a depth of 55 feet below ground and says itâ\x80\x99s the first significant paleontology site found in Austria in a century.Â\xa0', 'The bones are believed to be between 30,000 and 40,000 years old and belonged to at least three woolly mammoths. According to Hannah Parow-Souchon, the paleontologist leading the excavation, the discovery is significant because mammoth bones are rarely found packed together. This could mean they were bunched there by humans, which could indicate they were hunted and slaughtered by humans; the site might be the remains of a Holocene Epoch cookout.', 'Most archaeologists agree that humans gathered in groups and used spears and other tools to take down woolly mammoths and other megafauna, which would have been immense sources of meat, hides, and bones to use as raw materials for tools. This activity could have contributed to the animalsâ\x80\x99 extinction.Â\xa0', 'There is some debate whether preying on the massive beasts was a regular practice for Stone Age people, and science is foggy about how a band of simple humans could get the drop on an animal that stood 10 feet tall, weighed as much as six tons, and had fearsome protective tusks. The process would reveal a lot about coordination and planning among Paleolithic people.', 'Parow-Souchon said in a statement from the Austrian Academy of Sciences that it is possible that humans set a trap for mammoths there. She also said it was the most significant discovery of woolly mammoth remains in more than 100 years; most such sites in Europe have been dug up and hollowed out, with their archaeological value lost over time.', 'This is not the first such find in Kamptal.

9,7 Deep-Sea Sharks That Will Haunt Your Dreams,"['animals', 'oceans', 'shark', '2024SEOclean']","['Whether or not they deserve their notorious reputation, sharks are a common source of fear. But beachgoers shouldnâ\x80\x99t worry about coming face-to-face with these spooky specimensâ\x80\x94they all live at least 1000 feet below the oceanâ\x80\x99s surface. From ghost sharks to goblin sharks, weâ\x80\x99re here to shed light on the mysterious lives of these deep sea dwellers.', 'The first part of the Greenland sharkâ\x80\x99s scientific name, Somniosus microcephalus, means â\x80\x9csleep,â\x80\x9d a nod to its sluggish lifestyle. The second-largest predatory shark in the ocean moves at a glacial pace of one mile per hour. The drowsy name also makes sense in the context of the effect the shark has on those who eat it. Its flesh contains the toxic substance trimethylamine oxide, and ingesting it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, and the appearance of drunkenness (thatâ\x80\x99s why native Greenlanders call someone whoâ\x80\x99s had too much to drink â\x80\x9cshark-sickâ\x80\x9d). The sharks are also capable of having abnormally long lives. In 2016, researchers found a specimen that had been cruising deep beneath the Arctic seas for the past 392 years.', 'The goblin shark isnâ\x80\x99t known for its dazzling good looks. Its defining feature is a jagged mouth of teeth that becomes even more pronounced when it launches forward from the skull to seize prey. Fortunately for anyone disturbed by its appearance, the goblin shark occupies depths up to 4265 feet where looks arenâ\x80\x99t a priority.', 'A much bigger item on the speciesâ\x80\x99s evolutionary agenda is finding sustenance. Food is hard to come by that far below the surface, so the species adapted by developing a relatively large mouth for trapping squid, fish, and crustaceans that pass by. Theyâ\x80\x99ve long been known to Japanese fishermen (who originally named it tengu-zame after a long-nosed goblin from folktales), but much about these sharks still remains mysterious to scientists.', 'There are at least 32 species of demon catshark, including the white ghost catshark, the smalleye catshark, and the Iceland catshark (above), but scientists still know little about their lives at the bottom of the Northeast Atlantic. The slow-moving creatures grow up to 2 feet long and feed on squid and crustaceans as far as 7000 feet beneath the sea. Their flat heads and gleaming, slanted eyes earned them their demonic name. Another distinctive feature of the Apristurus genus are the two spineless dorsal fins poking up from the back of the body.', 'Not much light reaches the water 1640 feet beneath the oceanâ\x80\x99s surface, but swell sharks have developed a unique way to catch each otherâ\x80\x99s eyes. Their skin absorbs what little blue light there is at the bottom of the sea and transforms it into brilliant green biofluorescent light. Swell sharks have a photoreceptor in their eyes that lets them detect the glow, whereas humans cannot.', 'A couple of years ago, a team of researchers found their way around this by building a camera with a blue light-blocking yellow filter. This allowed them to explore underwater environments with â\x80\x9cshark vision.â\x80\x9d Scientists arenâ\x80\x99t entirely sure what function the biofluorescence serves, but they suspect itâ\x80\x99s used as a form of communication between sharks. Swell sharks have a different super power for dealing with enemies: When threatened, they suck in large gulps of water, swelling up to twice their size (hence the name).', ""This shark got its cutesy name from a rather gruesome behavior: When feeding, the 16- to 22-inch predators latch onto prey with suction cup lips and rotate to carve out medallions of meat. The wounds they leave behind are more scoop-like than cookie-shaped, and are inflicted on larger animals like marlin, tuna, wahoo, dolphins, and whales. They can be found 3200 feet deep during the day, but they wander upward at night to hunt, which has led to at least one attack on a human swimmer. Though a run-in with a cookie-cutter likely wouldnâ\x80\x99t be deadly, their creepy, tooth-filled â\x80\x9csmileâ\x80\x9d isnâ\x80\x99t something you'd want to see on a midnight swim."", 'Frilled sharks have been around for 80 million years, a fact thatâ\x80\x99s easier to process once you take a look at them. At the end of their prehistoric bodies is a mouth full of 300 teeth across 25 rows that glisten white to lure in prey.', 'The shark is named for its six pairs of gills which are each trimmed with red â\x80\x9cfrills.â\x80\x9d In 2007, a group of fishermen made history when they spotted a live frilled shark in shallow waters off the coast of Japan. The fish was taken to the Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka where it was transferred to a seawater pool. After some incredibly rare photographs were taken, the shark died a few hour later.', 'In 2009, scientists with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute recorded video of a strange creature 6700 feet deep into the Gulf of California. It had a long nose, ghoulish gray skin, and saucer-like eyes that stared blankly into the surrounding abyss. Seven years later, a team of experts identified the creature to be a pointy-nosed blue chimaera, a species of ghost shark never before caught live on tape.', 'Despite its name, the ghost shark isnâ\x80\x99t technically a shark. Chimaeras are close relatives that also use flexible cartilage in place of solid bone.

10,Having Anger Issues? Try âShreddingâ Your Feelings,"['live smarter', 'news', 'emotion', 'writing']","['Toddlers may be onto something: Destruction really does help relieve feelings of anger in a meaningful way, a new study published in Scientific Reports finds. But before you book an appointment at your nearest rage room, some reflection is necessary.', 'People have been looking for healthy outlets for their angry feelings for millennia. To test the rage-reducing effects of writing down oneâ\x80\x99s thoughts and then throwing them away, researchers in Japan experimented with two different exercises. First, they had college students write a short essay about how to solve a common social problem, such as smoking in public. They then told the participants that their essays would be returned to them graded. But instead of personalizing the essay feedback, the researchers automatically gave every participant low ratings in all of these categories: intelligence, interest, friendliness, logic, respectability, and rationality. ', 'To rub salt in the wound, they even wrote the following on each paper: â\x80\x9cI cannot believe an educated person would think like this. I hope this person learns something while at the university.â\x80\x9d', 'Each participant was told to sit and silently absorb their grade for two minutes. Researchers then instructed them to write down every thought they had about receiving the feedback, paying special attention to how it made them feel, with assurance that no one would read the paper.', 'Here comes the interesting part: Some participants were told to put their reflections through a shredder, some were told to throw them in the trash can, and some were told to keep them. Researchers observed that those who shredded or threw away the paper found it much easier to let go of their self-reported feelings of anger. Those who were told to hold onto their notes held onto their anger as well; the journaling exercise helped this group, but not nearly as much .

11,Should You Ever Park Under an Overpass During a Tornado?,"['weather', 'news', 'live smarter']","['There arenâ\x80\x99t many severe weather events that prompt as much concern as a tornado, a column of high winds that can cause massive and immediate destruction. ', 'Intuitively, people seek shelter. If theyâ\x80\x99re driving, that may mean feeling an urge to park under an overpass or bridge. But is that really the best decision?', 'The answer, according to experts, is no. Speaking with news outlet KFOR in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, meteorologist Aaron Brackett cautioned against viewing such structures as safeâ\x80\x94especially as tornado winds can actually increase underneath bridges. A tornado with winds moving at 100 mph can increase to 150 mph if air is being forced through a narrow area.', 'The fact that people may have the same idea only compounds the danger. â\x80\x9cAll it takes is a couple more vehicles doing the same exact thing and all of the sudden, you have a roadblock,â\x80\x9d Brackett said, explaining how the underpass on a four-lane road can quickly â\x80\x9cbecome a parking lot and everyone is at risk.â\x80\x9d', 'Tornadoes can also decimate such structures, causing falling debris while cars and passengers are immobile underneath. All things considered, stopping under an overpass can be a fatal mistake. KFOR even cited a 1999 tornado in which residents were killed owing to their choice of shelter.', 'This advice is echoed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which also noted that half of survey respondents thought seeking an overpass was a good idea. FEMA also cautions against parking under trees, which are also unlikely to provide any protection.', 'According to the National Weather Service, the safest place to be during a tornado event is indoorsâ\x80\x94ideally the basement of a building or a tornado shelter. Donâ\x80\x99t look for sheds or mobile homes, as they lack the necessary support to endure high winds. Truck stops or convenience stores are a better option.', 'If youâ\x80\x99re driving, your aim should be to get out of your car and into one of these structures: Get off the road (without blocking traffic) and find suitable shelter. If no building is nearby, you might be able to mitigate injury by staying in your car, keeping your seatbelt on and windows closed, and remaining low to the floor to avoid being hurt by broken glass. Leaving your vehicle and lying in the lowest spot to avoid flying debris and cars should be a last resort, since youâ\x80\x99d be putting yourself at significant risk for injury.', 'Outrunning a tornado isnâ\x80\x99t going to happen, but it may be possible to drive away from a tornado if you know its directional path.

(Also not true, though hepatitis and tuberculosis can be rare exceptions.)', 'Some myths are actually rooted in reality. Corpses can move a little as their ligaments stiffen, for example. But can the skin of a decedent experience a tan? Or is that strictly for the living?', 'Surprisingly, it can. A paper published in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology in 2023 (link here but beware some potentially disturbing images of dead bodies) tackled this very issue. Dubbed â\x80\x9cpostmortem tanning,â\x80\x9d the paper analyzed three instances of bodies that demonstrated sun damage via tan lines that matched their clothing.', 'In the first, a woman was found frozen. After thawing out in a laboratory setting, the body presented â\x80\x9cbrown pigment transformationâ\x80\x9d on exposed areas of the skin. The skin underneath her clothing, however, was unaffected.', 'Another body, this one male, was recovered following a motor vehicle accident. The tanned skin was consistent with the awkward pattern of their clothing arrangement, as they were a pedestrian struck by a car. Skin exposed as a result of bunched-up clothing was darkened following sun exposure during the several hours the body was left before it was located and retrieved.', 'The third case, this one a male who had a self-inflicted fatal gunshot wound, also presented with tanned skin from an area of the body exposed due to rumpled clothing.', 'What makes these scenarios unique is that tanning is essentially the skinâ\x80\x99s response to damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays, a metabolic process that would seem to be nonexistent in the dead. In two of the cases, the bodies were discovered in freezing temperatures, leading authors to theorize that the necessary metabolic pathways were preserved. But that fails to explain the third body, which was retrieved in a warm summer climate.', 'The paper does not indicate whether any of the three bodies were actually sunburned, only tan. Sunburn is defined as erythema (redness) and blistering in the hours or days following sun exposure. As these symptoms werenâ\x80\x99t mentioned, itâ\x80\x99s unclear whether a dead body can mount such a response.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s important to note that there are other causes of skin color changes in death. Mummification can prompt darkening of the skin when it becomes dehydrated and brittle, as in dry, hot climates. Thereâ\x80\x99s also a phenomenon known as â\x80\x9cbog body formation,â\x80\x9d in which corpses left in acidic peat bogs prompt a chemical response in the skin that can lead to browning.', 'While the subject matter may appear morbid, postmortem tanning could be a key factor in forensic analysis. Posthumous sunning can help determine a time of death and potentially lead to answers in a criminal investigation.

A recent study out of China can help shed light on the subject. As Food & Wine reports, scientists closely observed the changing structures of ethanol molecules at various temperatures. Though their test subject was baijiu, a Chinese grain spirit typically enjoyed at room temp, the findings were still relevant enough to support other types of beer. In simple terms, as temperatures lower, ethanol clusters in beer tighten to form a chain-like shape, resulting in better, more robust flavor.', 'How cold is cold, you ask? Itâ\x80\x99s a descriptor thatâ\x80\x99s open to interpretation. However, the Brewers Association, an American organization dedicated to all things brewing, has a guide [PDF] chock full of  recommended temperatures for different types of beer.

Beer thatâ\x80\x99s too icy can mask aromas and flavors.', 'Even the color of a beer bottle or the angle of the pour can significantly impact or enhance the experience.

14,6 Scientific Benefits of Reading More,"['books', 'science', 'lists']","['Reading transports us to worlds we would never see, introduces us to people we would never meet, and instills emotions we might never otherwise feel. It also provides an array of health benefits. Here are six scientific reasons you should be picking up more books.', 'In 2009, scientists at the University of Sussex in the UK assessed how different activities lowered stress by measuring heart rate and muscle tension. Reading a book or newspaper for just six minutes lowered peopleâ\x80\x99s stress levels by 68 percentâ\x80\x94a stronger effect than going for a walk (42 percent), drinking a cup of tea or coffee (54 percent), or listening to music (61 percent). According to the authors, the ability to be fully immersed and distracted is what makes reading the perfect way to relieve stress.', 'A daily dose of reading may lengthen your lifespan. A team at Yale University followed more than 3600 adults over the age of 50 for 12 years. They discovered that people who reported reading books for 30 minutes a day lived nearly two years longer than those who read magazines or newspapers. Participants who read more than 3.5 hours per week were 23 percent less likely to die, and participants who read less than 3.5 hours per week were 17 percent less likely to die. â\x80\x9cThe benefits of reading books include a longer life in which to read them,â\x80\x9d the authors wrote.', 'In the 1990s, reading pioneer Keith Stanovich and his colleagues conducted dozens of reading studies to assess the relationship between cognitive skills, vocabulary, factual knowledge, and exposure to certain fiction and nonfiction authors. They used the Author Recognition Test (ART), which is a strong predictor of reading skill. Stanovich tells Mental Floss that the average result of these studies was that avid readers, as measured by the ART, had around a 50 percent larger vocabulary and 50 percent more fact-based knowledge.', 'Reading both predicts and contributes to those skills, according to Donald Bolger, a human development professor at the University of Maryland who researches how the brain learns to read. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s like a snowball effect,â\x80\x9d he tells Mental Floss. â\x80\x9cThe better you are at reading, the more words you learn.

Across five experiments, those who read literary fiction performed better on tasks like predicting how characters would act and identifying the emotion encoded in facial expressions. These speak to the ability to understand othersâ\x80\x99 mental states, which scientists call Theory of Mind.', 'â\x80\x9cIf we engage with characters who are nuanced, unpredictable, and difficult to understand, then I think weâ\x80\x99re more likely to approach people in the real world with an interest and humility necessary for dealing with complex individuals,â\x80\x9d study lead author David Kidd, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, tells Mental Floss.', 'â\x80\x9cIn our real lives, we often feel like we have to make a decision, and therefore we close our mind to information that could eventually help us,â\x80\x9d says Maja Djikic, a psychologist at the University of Toronto. â\x80\x9cWhen we read fiction, we practice keeping our minds open because we can afford uncertainty.â\x80\x9d', 'Djikic came to that conclusion after she conducted a study in which 100 people were assigned to read a fictional story or a nonfiction essay. The participants then completed questionnaires intended to assess their level of cognitive closure, which is the need to reach a conclusion quickly and avoid ambiguity in the decision-making process. The fiction readers emerged as more flexible and creative than the essay readersâ\x80\x94and the effect was strongest for people who read on a regular basis.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s not often that we can identify moments when our personality changes and evolves, but reading fiction may help us do just that. The same University of Toronto research team asked 166 people to fill out questionnaires regarding their emotions and key personality traits, based on the widely used Big Five Inventory, which measures extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability/neuroticism, and openness.

', 'Someone less than thrilled with how Jaws led people to feel about sharks was Dr. Donald â\x80\x9cReefâ\x80\x9d Nelson, science advisor on both the original film and its 1978 sequel, and part of the inspiration for Richard Dreyfussâ\x80\x99s character, oceanographer and double-denim enthusiast Matt Hooper.', 'When Nelson had his first encounter with a shark back in 1959, scientists knew very little about their behavior. Theyâ\x80\x99d looked at dead ones and spied live ones from afar, but firsthand encounters tended to be brief and often slightly more frenzied than the conditions science tends to favor.Â\xa0', 'Nelson had finished a degree in biology at Rutgers University in 1958 and subsequently moved to Florida toâ\x80\x94among other thingsâ\x80\x94join the awesomely-named spear-fishing team, the Glug Glugs. He had an epiphany after spearing a grunt, a small but surprisingly loud fish, which reacted to being speared by making a lot of noise. A tiger shark immediately appeared, which Nelson then also proceeded to spear.', 'But he took more home with him than just the fish and shark: He also had an idea. Were sharks attracted to sound? Nobody had investigated that before, so along with his research partner Samuel â\x80\x9cSonnyâ\x80\x9d Gruber, he looked into it. The pair recorded fake sounds of struggling fish like his screaming grunt and played them underwater from an ultrasonic speaker that had been developed by the Navy. Those low-frequency vibrations drew in an astonishing 22 sharks, and the pair published their findings in Science in 1963 while still grad students.', 'In the years leading up to Nelsonâ\x80\x99s research, there had been several high-profile incidents in which the U.S. Navy had suffered huge casualties thanks to sharks. The story of the USS Indianapolis that Quint (Robert Shaw) famously tells in the original Jaws was based on a real event, and several similar incidents had occurred in the Pacific, as well as the South Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. ', 'What Nelson and Gruber had uncovered during their research would help to save lives. They found that the same kind of sounds made by an injured, thrashing fish can be made by swimmers, something that can work out pretty sub-optimally for those swimmers. By 1965, Nelson was in California, working as a biology professor at Cal State Long Beach and trying to develop ways to repel sharks (including via a cattle-like prod that was intended to stun one if it drew too close), although none of them worked out. Perhaps coincidentally, Adam Westâ\x80\x99s Batman had a can of shark repellent in 1966â\x80\x99s Batman: The Movie, which was shot in California. Â\xa0', 'More interesting than repelling sharks, though, was getting as close to them as possible. For a while, Nelson did this in the most absurdly badass way possible, by free-diving up to 60 feet and chasing reef sharks until they got angry, something known as the Kamikaze technique. By doing this, he observed reef sharksâ\x80\x99 â\x80\x9cagonistic display,â\x80\x9d meaning the behavior they performed when under threat.Â\xa0', 'Around this time in the early 1970s, a young Steven Spielberg made a visit to the Shark Lab at Cal State, which Nelson had founded in 1966. Nelsonâ\x80\x99s lifelong habit of drawing on napkins and scraps of paper meant his office was a messy, shark-filled dream, especially for a filmmaker. This wasnâ\x80\x99t a side of scientists that viewers were used to seeing, but it workedâ\x80\x94Spielberg made photocopies of all the maps, scribbled napkin notes, and photos he saw and his team ultimately recreated everything for Hooperâ\x80\x99s office in Jaws. ', 'Although Nelson was involved with the making of Jaws and Jaws 2, he didnâ\x80\x99t let Hollywood go to his head. Even after Jaws, he was still using the Kamikaze technique, and he only retired it in 1976 after a close call with a very combative shark. ', 'He swiftly invented a â\x80\x8bâ\x80\x8bone-person, fiberglass submarine known as the SOS, or Shark Observation Submersible, and got right back to studying sharks up-close in their underwater environment. He even took video footage, and along with his team, eventually developed methods for tracking sharks using ultrasonic transmitters. This kind of acoustic transmitter technology served as a precursor to the technologically advanced tracking methods used today.', 'In the process, he learned so, so much about sharks. His team was the second in the world to put a transmitter on a shark in the wild, which opened up a whole new world of discovery. Everyone had assumed they were solitary, mindless killing machines, but Nelson and other scientists at the Shark Lab learned that they were in fact much more social than suspected, far less aggressive (except when threatened), and some species had complex, mutually beneficial relationships with other ocean-dwellers. There was vastly more to them than just being the sharp-toothed murderers-in-waiting depicted in those films.', 'Unfortunately, post-Jaws, there were a great many people who simply didnâ\x80\x99t want to know.Â\xa0', 'Both Spielberg and Peter Benchley, co-screenwriter on Jaws and author of the original novel, expressed regret over rendering the public so terrified of sharks, as well as disappointment in the shark killings that followed. In 1978, Nelson himself had endorsed a publicity poster accompanying Jaws 2 that scared the crap out of a lot of people, as it was claimed that the â\x80\x9cseas off our shores are aprowl with many killersâ\x80\x9d and that sharks were capable of attacking in freshwater and causing boats to sink, so it was essential for audience-goers to â\x80\x9cknow their enemy.â\x80\x9d', 'But by the time Nelson died in 1997, humanity had a far more detailed knowledge of the world of sharksâ\x80\x94knowledge used to keep people safe from them, but also to protect them from people. With all the video footage of sharks that he had captured with his team, Nelson was able to make over 20 documentaries between 1968 and 1994, most of which were shown in school classrooms or aired on TV. A glowing memorial published in 2001 by the journal Environmental Biology of Fishes [PDF] praised Nelson as â\x80\x9can ultimate marine biologist.â\x80\x9d ', 'Over the course of his career, which had spanned more than three decades, Nelson influenced multiple generations of scientists to follow in his (wet) footsteps and explore the worlds of these fascinating creatures.

18,9 Interesting Facts About the Ribs | Mental Floss,"['biology', 'science']","['Ribs are not just an incredibly tasty order on the menu at the nearest steak house: These bony spindles in your torso attach to your sternum (breast bone) to protect your lungs, heart, spleen, and most of the liver and help with giving shape to your chest cavity, which assists in breathing. Ribs are protective on the one hand, but if badly broken, your ribs can turn lethal to you, piercing your organs. Mental Floss spoke to John Martinez, MD, an urgent care provider with Dignity Health Medical Foundation in California for these nine fascinating facts about the ribs.', 'The ribs allow chest expansion for breathing, Martinez explains. ""They function similarly to the bucket handle on a bucket and swing upwards as we take a breath, allowing the thoracic cavity to expand."" This increase in the thoracic cavity makes it easier to take a breath.', 'The human skeleton has 12 pairs of ribs. Working from the top of the torso down, ribs 1 to 7 are considered ""true ribs,"" as they connect directly from the spine to the sternum, Martinez says. Ribs 8 to 10 are called ""false ribs"" because they don\'t connect directly, but have cartilage that attaches them to the sternum.

Below, some dead body myths that won't give up the ghostâ\x80\x94and explanations of the real-life science behind them."", 'Not true! The cell division driving hair and nail growth stops when the body dies and the heart no longer pumps oxygen-filled blood throughout the circulatory system. It does look like things keep growing, though. When a dead body\'s skin loses hydration, it retractsâ\x80\x94and retraction along the nail bed makes it appear as if the nails are getting longer. As for hair, drying skin on the face and head ""pulls back towards the skull, making stubble appear more prominent,"" writes Claudia Hammond for the BBC. ""Goosebumps caused by the contraction of the hair muscles can add to the effect.""', ""There's no science to back up the idea that a dead and decomposing body is harmful to the living just by virtue of its being dead. This might sound obvious, but the belief that disease came from breathing in air infected by corpses was once common."", 'The miasma theory, as it was called, was a widespread belief among members of the medical profession (and the public) in the 19th century. Miasma, an ancient Greek word for â\x80\x9cpollution,â\x80\x9d was the bad air coming from â\x80\x9crotting corpses, the exhalations of other people already infected, sewage, or even rotting vegetationâ\x80\x9d and was thought to be responsible for the spread of disease, according to a 2001 paper in BMJ. Fortunately, this belief was eventually replaced by germ theory.', 'In a 2005 publication from the Pan American Health Organization (a division of the World Health Organization), Donna Eberwine explained that the belief that dead bodies spread disease ""remains a chronic problem in disaster relief efforts."" After natural disasters, there is often hysteria around dead bodies and a rush to immediately bury them, which distracts relief efforts from more pressing concerns. ""The microorganisms that are involved in decomposition are not the kind that cause disease,"" Eberwine writes. ""And most viruses and bacteria that do cause disease cannot survive more than a few hours in a dead body.""', 'There are some exceptions. The level of Ebola virus in dead victims can remain high, and their remains should only be handled by people in protective gear (and buried quickly). HIV can live for up to 16 days in a body held under refrigeration, and other blood-borne viruses like hepatitis, along with tuberculosis and gastrointestinal infections, can pose a risk. ""The risk of contagion can be minimized with basic precautions and proper hygiene,"" Eberwine wrote.', '""Embalming provides no public health benefit,"" according to the Funeral Consumer\'s Alliance (a nonprofit focused on affordable death care), citing the CDC and Canadian authorities. While individual morticians might say that a body must be embalmed before viewing or burial, the process is not legally required if the body will be cremated or refrigerated for viewing prior to burial or cremation. Moreover, since a dead body is usually not in itself harmful, embalming does not make it any safer. On the flip side, embalming chemicals are actually quite toxic, and embalmers must cover their entire body and wear a respirator while working.Â\xa0', ""This horror-movie trope just isn't real. During decomposition, a body might twitch or make small movements and noises due to the gas and waste released by bacteria. A decomposing corpse can definitely move a little, but sitting straight up is just not going to happen."", 'Nope! Burials usually occur at 3.5 feet below the groundâ\x80\x99s surface, whereas potable water can be 75 feet underground. ""Mandatory setbacks from known water sources also ensure that surface water is not at risk,"" the Green Burial Council explains [PDF]. Additionally, because microorganisms living in the soil will break down the chemical compounds that remain in a dead body, we actually give out ""more toxic chemicals during a day of living than a whole body will decomposing.""', 'Though we often talk of ""scattering ashes,"" cremains are a little more complicated. Once a body intended for cremation has been burned in what\'s called a retort, what\'s left will be put in a cremulator. Sort of like a blender, the cremulator uses ball bearings or rotating blades to pulverize the bones and other remnants into a ""grayish, coarse material, like fine gravel,"" as HowStuffWorks puts it.', 'According to psychological scientist Kurt Gray, it\'s possible that death isn\'t quite as terrifying as we think it is. Gray studied the responses of death row inmates and terminally ill patients as well as those of people asked to imagine they had untreatable cancer, and found that ""while it\'s natural to fear death in the abstract, the closer one actually gets to it, the more positive he or she becomes,"" as New York Magazine explains. This may be due to something called the ""psychological immune system,"" a term coined by Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert in his book Stumbling on Happiness.

When the thermometer came out of your mouth, it had to read higher than 98.6Â°Fâ\x80\x94the long-accepted â\x80\x9cnormalâ\x80\x9d human body temperature. (If you wanted to really seal the deal, you may have hoped to hit 100Â°F.) Since then, you may have used a temperature above 98.6Â°F as a metric to work from home (or call out sick entirely).', ""You may be shocked to learn that the average body temperature isn't actually 98.6Â°Fâ\x80\x94a fact that weâ\x80\x99ve known for more than 30 years. A 2023 study by Stanford Medicine researchers found that not only is the average human body temp more like 97.9Â°F, but an individualâ\x80\x99s normal range can be influenced by sex, age, height, weight, and even the time of day. "", 'The 98.6Â°F myth originated in the 19th century with a single doctor, and despite evidence to the contrary, itâ\x80\x99s persisted ever since.', 'In 1851, Carl Wunderlich, the director of the hospital at Leipzig University, began going from room to room with a comically large thermometer in tow. He wanted to understand how body temperature is affected by different diseases, so in each room, he would hold the foot-long device in patientsâ\x80\x99 armpits for a full 20 minutes, waiting for a temperature to register. Once it did, heâ\x80\x99d note the temperature on the patientâ\x80\x99s chart (Wunderlich is thought to be the first physician to do so). He and his staff did this for years, repeatedly taking the temperatures of some 25,000 patients and logging them on their charts, until he had millions of readings. In 1868, he finally published this data in Das Verhalten der Eigenwarme in Krankheiten (On the Temperature in Diseases: A Manual of Medical Thermometry). He concluded that the average human body temperature was 98.6Â°F, underscoring the idea that fever is a symptom of illness, not a cause.', 'No one questioned Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s methods, or his average, for about 140 years. Then, in the early 1990s, internist Philip Mackowiakâ\x80\x94a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland, a medical historian, and, apparently, a clinical thermometer enthusiastâ\x80\x94saw one of the physicianâ\x80\x99s instruments at the MÃ¼tter Museum in Philadelphia. He told the Freakonomics podcast that heâ\x80\x99d always had doubts about the 98.6Â°F standard. â\x80\x9cI am by nature a skeptic,â\x80\x9d he said. â\x80\x9cAnd it occurred to me very early in my career that this idea that 98.6 was normal, and then if you didnâ\x80\x99t have a temperature of 98.6, you were somehow abnormal, just didnâ\x80\x99t sit right.â\x80\x9d', 'Getting his hands on Wunderlichâ\x80\x98s thermometerâ\x80\x94which the museum let him borrowâ\x80\x94only deepened his doubts. The huge thermometer was unwieldy and non-registering, meaning, Mackowiak explained, â\x80\x9cthat it has to be read while itâ\x80\x99s in place.â\x80\x9d Not only that, but Wunderlich had used the device to measure temperatures in the armpit, which is less reliable than temperatures taken in the mouth or rectum. The instrument itself also wasnâ\x80\x99t terribly precise: It measured up to 2Â°C higher than both ancient and modern instruments.', 'In 1992, Mackowiak decided to test Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s average. Using normal-sized oral thermometers and a group of volunteers, the data suggested that the average human body temperature hovered around 98.2Â°F. Mackowiak found that body temperature tends to vary over the course of the day, with its lowest point around 6 a.m. and its highest in the early evening. Body temperature can also fluctuate monthly (with the menstrual cycle) and over a lifetime (declining decade by decade with age), and may even be differentially linked to sex and race. He concluded that normal body temperature is unique to each person, almost like a fingerprint, and given that wide variation, not actually a very reliable indicator of illness.', 'As a result of his study, Mackowiak proposed raising the threshold for fever to 98.9Â°F for temperatures taken in the morning (and 99.9Â°F at other times). While itâ\x80\x99s a relatively minor change in terms of actual degrees, this fever threshold is lower than the CDCâ\x80\x99s, which is a temperature of 100.4Â°F or higher.', 'There are potential real-life consequences in this gap, for everyone from students (whoâ\x80\x99d have to attend school with what would be considered a low-grade fever by Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s 98.6Â°F standard) to employers and daycares (which use temperature to set attendance policies). Whatâ\x80\x99s more, anyone who is actually sick but ignores a low-grade feverâ\x80\x94one that meets Mackowiakâ\x80\x99s threshold but still falls under the CDCâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x94could pose a risk to people with compromised immune systems trying to avoid unnecessary exposure to illness in public places.', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s a reason the average trends near 98Â°F instead of 92Â°F or 106Â°F. As endotherms, mammals expend a great deal of energy maintaining body temperature when compared with cold-blooded creatures. To find and conserve a just-right body temperature, central nervous system sensors gather data (too warm? too cold? just right, Goldilocks?) and send that information to the pebble-sized hypothalamus near the base of the brain. There, the data is converted into action: releasing sweat and widening the blood vessels if too warm; raising metabolism, constricting the blood vessels, and inducing shivering if too cold.', ""According to a study by Aviv Bergman and Arturo Casadevall in the journal mBio, the precise balancing point for ideal body temperature is the sweet spot where the metabolic cost for all this thermoregulation balances with the evolutionary advantage of warding off fungal disease. (While warm-blooded animals are prone to bacterial or viral infections, they rarely experience fungal infections because most fungi can't withstand temperatures above 86Â°F. Cold-blooded animals, on the other hand, are prone to all three.) For Bergman and Casadevall, this benefit even explains what tipped Darwin's scales in favor of mammals, allowing them to edge out other vertebrates for dominance after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs."", 'Of course, rules call for exceptions, and the one place where human body temperature demonstrates sustained elevation is outer space. Astronauts on prolonged missions clock significantly higher average body temperatures than they do when terrestrialâ\x80\x94even up to 104Â°F. This so-called â\x80\x9cspace feverâ\x80\x9d is probably a product of some combination of radiation exposure, psychological stress, and immune response to weightlessness. Researchers believe this phenomenon could yield crucial information about thermoregulationâ\x80\x94and may even offer insight into how humans might adapt to climate change.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s been more than three decades years since Mackowiakâ\x80\x99s study and other research that supports his findings, yet the newer data has not taken hold among medical professionals or the public. What gives?', 'Mackowiak tells Mental Floss that he finds it a bit mystifying that the myth persists, especially since many people, when pressed, know that the so-called â\x80\x9caverageâ\x80\x9d temperature varies.

23,Is Water Wet?

If itâ\x80\x99s raining and you forget your umbrella, you get soakedâ\x80\x94thus, water is wet.', 'If approached from a scientific or philosophical perspective, however, the question becomes quite the conundrum. The answer then depends on the properties of water, the definition of wetness, and whether you can trust when your senses inform you if something is wet or not.', 'Some argue that while water can make other materials wet, water itself isnâ\x80\x99t wet. If we define wetness as the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid, then wetness isnâ\x80\x99t an inherent quality of water so much as a propertyâ\x80\x94an action the liquid can perform.', 'Scientifically speaking, the wetness of an object depends on the relationship between adhesive and cohesive forces of the liquids and solids that are brought into contact with one another. While cohesive forces cause molecules in a liquid to stick together, adhesive forces are what allow liquids to stick to solids. When we fall into the water and our clothes get wet, what really happens is that the adhesive forces of our clothes outweigh the cohesive forces of the water, causing water to adhere not to itself, but to our clothes.', 'The greater a solidâ\x80\x99s adhesive force, the wetter that solid gets. The adhesive forces of textiles are stronger than those of metals; most liquids slide right off anything made of steel, aluminum, or the like. The same goes for the feathery coats of ducks and geese. When the birds preen, they distribute oils from glands near their tails throughout their feathers, which helps make their bodies more water-resistant [PDF]. If they didnâ\x80\x99t waterproof themselves in this way, water would stick to them like it sticks to human skin, weighing them down and cooling them off.', 'The same goes for water-resistant or â\x80\x9chydrophobicâ\x80\x9d materials such as Gore-Tex, which has a low adhesive force that causes water molecules to coalesce on the outside of the material, keeping the inside dry. Wetsuits used by swimmers to keep warm in cold climates are commonly made of neoprene rubber, another hydrophobic material.', 'Conversely, wetness also depends on the cohesive forces of a liquid. The cohesive force of water is high due to the strong bond between hydrogen molecules, but other liquids like alcohol or acetone have a lower cohesive force, making them better at wetting solids.

24,"9 Facts About the Denisovans, Our Mysterious Human Ancestor","['archaeology', 'anthropology', 'fossils', 'evolution']","['Only a handful of tiny fossils of the Denisovansâ\x80\x94human ancestors who went extinct about 30,000 years agoâ\x80\x94have ever been discovered. Yet, thanks to advances in DNA analysis, scientists have uncovered intriguing clues about their lives. Read on for nine facts about the mysterious Denisovans.', 'Today, all modern humans are Homo sapiens, but as a species we have taken millennia to evolve. The very earliest human ancestors (a.k.a. hominins) emerged around 7 million years ago, while species in our genus, Homo, began appearing about 2.3 million years ago. Within the last 150 years or so, scientists have discovered evidence for at least eight different hominins in Homo, from Homo erectus, the first to migrate out of Africa, to the tiny Homo floresiensis, who stood only 3 feet, 6 inches tall.', 'In 2010, Russian scientists Michael Shunkov and Anatoly Derevianko unearthed a tiny finger bone in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. The fragment was sent to the Max Planck Institute in Germany for DNA analysis, where a team led by paleogeneticist Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo determined that the bone came from an unknown type of archaic human, closely related to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis.', 'The first bone fragment was found in the Denisova cave, which lent its name to the mysterious hominins. This incredible site is the only place in the world known to have been occupied by more than one hominin group. Fossils and debris from the many layers of cave floor provide evidence that the cave was inhabited by Denisovans roughly 200,000 years ago, by Neanderthals 100,000 years ago, and by modern humans. At some point, the two groups of extinct hominins may have coexisted there.', 'The Denisovans are especially mysterious because archaeologists have uncovered so few fossils, meaning that we donâ\x80\x99t really know what they looked like. The only known fossils so far confirmed as Denisovan include three loose teeth, a skull fragment, a finger bone, half of a broken jawbone, and four other small slivers of bone. The remains were identified as Denisovan by protein or DNA analysis rather than morphology, and fascinating questions about the physical characteristics of these ancient human ancestors are still to be answered.', 'Scientists continue to search for more Denisovan bones. Fossils found in China, Taiwan, and Kyrgyzstan are thought to be likely contenders; however, their poor quality have precluded any DNA extraction and analysis. At this stage, itâ\x80\x99s unclear if they are Denisovan or belong to another hominin group.', 'The Denisovans are the only hominin identified as distinct from other hominins by DNA alone. Because so few of their fossils have been foundâ\x80\x94and because the ones we have are mere fragmentsâ\x80\x94scientists havenâ\x80\x99t determined the anatomy of a Denisovan. Without the physical description, they canâ\x80\x99t be confirmed as a new species or subspecies. For now, Denisovans are considered a â\x80\x9cpopulationâ\x80\x9d in the genus Homo.', 'Researchers looking at human evolution have suggested that the human ancestor Homo heidelbergensis, which lived between 600,000 and 300,000 years ago, left Africa about 400,000 years ago. Some moved west into Europe and likely evolved into Neanderthals, while others traveled into central Asia and became the Denisovans.', 'Hominin groups that remained in Africa evolved into Homo sapiens. By 60,000 years ago, this group had also migrated into Europe and Asia, and lived alongside Neanderthals and Denisovans for several thousand years.', 'In 2018, analysis of a bone fragment found in Siberia revealed that it came from a teenage girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, providing the only known evidence of a first-generation hybrid hominin. The girl, nicknamed â\x80\x9cDenny,â\x80\x9d was thought to have lived 90,000 years ago. DNA evidence shows that Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans were related closely enough that they could interbreed and bear children, and that Neanderthals and Denisovans were more closely related to each other than to Homo sapiens.', 'The fossilized remains of Denisovans come from just two locations, Siberia and Tibet (though a tooth found in Laos may also be Denisovan). Their genetic legacy, however,  suggests they inhabited large swaths of Asia. DNA analysis of modern humans in Southeast Asia shows that many people have traces of Denisovan DNA, suggesting modern humans in the region interbred with Denisovans many thousands of years ago and indicating that they lived much farther south than had been initially thought.', 'Genetic evidence from Papua New Guinea hints that some modern humans may have interbred with Denisovans as recently as 25,000 years ago, implying that Homo sapiens and Denisovans coexisted in these areas for thousands of years. Today, the Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines, modern New Guineans, and Aboriginal Australians may be able to attribute 5 or 6 percent of their genes to Denisovan DNA.', 'The Denisovans lived harsh environments, from the cold, frozen steppes of Siberia to the high altitudes of Tibet. The excavations in Laos also suggest that some Denisovan communities lived in the lush tropical woodlands of Southeast Asia. The variety of the Denisovansâ\x80\x99 habitats implies that they readily adapted to the climates in which they migrated and settled. In fact, scientists working in Tibet found that modern Tibetans may have inherited a Denisovan gene that helped them adapt to the low-oxygen environment at high altitudes.', 'Some scientists suggest that Denisovans went extinct as recently as 20,000 years ago. They may have died out due to extensive interbreeding with other hominins, meaning that they slowly became absorbed into the wider human population. Itâ\x80\x99s also possible that as Homo sapiens encroached on Denisovan habitats, they outcompeted them for food, or introduced deadly diseases that contributed to the Denisovansâ\x80\x99 demise. In the future, if more Denisovan remains are identified, archaeologists may be able to discover more answers to these elusive early hominins.', 'Read More Stories About Human Evolution:', 'manual', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/denisovans-facts

Or at least, your body thought you were. And thatâ\x80\x99s because of tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, which is the main psychoactive component in marijuana.', 'A 2015 study conducted on mice by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine found that THC flipped a switch in the rodentsâ\x80\x99 brain circuitry, making them feel hungry rather than full.', 'â\x80\x9cBy observing how the appetite center of the brain responds to marijuana, we were able to see what drives the hunger brought about by cannabis and how that same mechanism that normally turns off feeding becomes a driver of eating,â\x80\x9d said Tamas Horvath, the studyâ\x80\x99s lead author.', 'â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s like pressing a carâ\x80\x99s brakes and accelerating instead,â\x80\x9d Horvath explained. â\x80\x9cWe were surprised to find that the neurons we thought were responsible for shutting down eating, were suddenly being activated and promoting hunger, even when you are full.

You canâ\x80\x99t get kids to eat broccoli.', 'There definitely seems to be something about boogers that is simply irresistible to many children. Glance at a group of five or more children, and chances are good that at least one of them will likely have their finger either thrust up their bulging nostril halfway to their brain or poking the flake/chunk/globule sourced from within said nostril into their mouths. Yes, children can be truly disgusting.', 'Boogers, of course, form in the nose, when some of the mucus that is constantly produced gets dried out. The purpose of nasal mucus is to stop potentially harmful particles and pathogens found within the air from being inhaled. Instead, they are caught by wet, sticky snot and taken down the throat to be dealt with in the stomach. Larger particles, or large amounts of them, can form bigger sticky chunks or linger long enough to dry out, which is when the stuff in your nose goes from sniffable to pickable.', ""Aside from being gross, the act of picking one's nose is inadvisable, as a probing finger can introduce all sorts of infectious materials into the body, as well as pass illnesses on to other people.  Picking your nose and then shaking hands with someone, for example, is one way to spread pneumonia. You can also damage the inside of your nose, which can cause nosebleeds."", 'As for the booger-eatingâ\x80\x94or, to use its more elegant name, mucophagyâ\x80\x94opinions differ, health-wise. In 2013 Scott Napper, an associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, sparked headlines around the world when he proposed a theory that evolution might suggest that eating boogers is one way to boost your immune system, and that boogersâ\x80\x99 deliciousness was an advantageous mutation. He suggested that by ingesting these particles rather than blowing them out (or wiping them under a school desk), children were increasing their immunity, via exposure, to any illnesses they could cause.', 'However, as other scientists have pointed out, the majority of the mucus you produce gets swallowed anyway, so the small percentage of it that makes a brief journey outside before being chomped is unlikely to add many health benefits to the proceedings.', 'A more pointed answer to the question of why kids eat their boogers is just because they like the taste. Tastiness is key to Napperâ\x80\x99s theoryâ\x80\x94and a frequently cited 1966 look [PDF] into derivatives of coprophagia (the eating of poop) by psychiatrist Sidney Tarachow states: â\x80\x9cThe patients enjoy these activities.

Make some time for the celestial show and youâ\x80\x99ll probably see meteors zooming across the heavens every few minutes. Here is everything you need to know about this meteor shower.', 'Every 415.5 years, the comet Thatcher circles the sun in a highly eccentric orbit shaped almost like a catâ\x80\x99s eye. At its farthest from the sun, itâ\x80\x99s billions of miles from Pluto; at its nearest, it swings between  Earth and Mars. (The last time it was near Earth was in 1861, and it wonâ\x80\x99t be that close again until 2280.) Thatâ\x80\x99s quite a journey, and more pressingly, quite a variation in temperature. The closer it gets to the sun, the more debris it sheds. That debris is what youâ\x80\x99re seeing when you see a meteor shower: dust-sized particles slamming into Earthâ\x80\x99s atmosphere at tens of thousands of miles per hour. In a competition between the two, Earth is going to win, and â\x80\x9cshooting starsâ\x80\x9d are the result of energy released as the particles are vaporized. You can expect to see 20 meteors per hour during a Lyrid event.', 'The comet was first spotted on April 4, 1861, by A.E. Thatcher, an amateur skywatcher in New York City, earning him kudos from the noted astronomer Sir John Herschel. Clues to the cometâ\x80\x99s discovery are in its astronomical designation, C/1861 G1. The C means itâ\x80\x99s a long-period comet with an orbit of more than 200 years; G stands for the first half of April, and the 1 indicates it was the first comet discovered in that timeframe.', 'Sightings of the Lyrid meteor showerâ\x80\x94named after Lyra, the constellation it appears to originate fromâ\x80\x94are much older; the first record dates to China in the 7th century BCE.', 'The night of April 21, 2024, features a waxing gibbous moon that will be almost full; the full moon, dubbed the â\x80\x9cpink moonâ\x80\x9d after the spring flowers that tend to bloom at this time, is on April 23. That means that the moon will probably reflect significant light and obscure views of the meteors. ', 'For your best shot at witnessing the Lyrids, youâ\x80\x99re going to need to get away from local light pollution and find truly dark skies. You should completely avoid smartphones, flashlights, car headlights, or dome lights. The goal is to let your eyes adjust totally to the darkness. Once you find your viewing area, just lay out your blanket, get comfy, look up, and wait. In an hour, youâ\x80\x99ll be able to see the night sky with surprising clarity.', 'Where is the nearest dark sky to where you live? You can find out on the Dark Site Finder map. ', 'You donâ\x80\x99t need a telescope to see a meteor shower, but if you bring one, aim it south to find Jupiter. Itâ\x80\x99s the bright, unblinking spot in the sky. With a telescope, you should be able to make out its stripes. Those five stars surrounding it are the constellation Libra. Youâ\x80\x99ll notice also four tiny points of light nearby. Those are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. When Galileo discovered those moons in 1610, he was able to prove the Copernican model of heliocentricity: that Earth goes around the sun.', 'If you miss the show this April, donâ\x80\x99t panicâ\x80\x94the Lyrid meteor shower will be back next year, and the year after, and so on. But if you are eager for another celestial display before then, the Eta Aquarids will be at their strongest on May 4 and 5, 2024.

29,How an Amateur Astronomer Discovered Uranus,"['astronomy', 'history', 'science', 'space', '2024SEOclean']","['On March 13, 1781, William Herschel looked through his telescope and saw Uranus. It was a monumental discovery for the world of science, but that wasnâ\x80\x99t the only reason it was impressive.', 'First, the telescopes of the time were extremely limited. Herschelâ\x80\x99s homemade device was more or less a tube-shaped magnifying glass, especially when compared to todayâ\x80\x99s high-powered sky-scanning technology.', 'Second, Herschel was a relative newcomer to astronomy. Heâ\x80\x99d spent most of his earlier life as a successful composer and musician, only developing an interest in the night sky at the age of 34. A few years later, Herschel was up one night, staring at the constellation Gemini, when he found a cometâ\x80\x94or so he thought. The object in question looked more like a flat disk, and while it moved, it appeared to be too slow to be a comet. Further observations confirmed that Herschel had in fact found a new planetâ\x80\x94the first to be discovered with a telescope.', 'As the discoverer, Herschel figured he had naming rights. He suggested Georgium Sidisâ\x80\x94literally â\x80\x9cGeorgeâ\x80\x99s Starâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94in honor of his patron, King George III, but his contemporaries argued for a more dignified and less nationalist name. They opted for Uranus, following the established protocol of naming planets after ancient gods. ', 'In Greek mythology, Uranus is the primordial god of the sky and the son/husband of Gaea, the goddess of the Earth. Their many offspring included the Titans, dieties who overthrew their father and established Cronus, the youngest Titan, as the ruler of the world. Cronus (a.k.a. Saturn of Roman myth) was eventually overthrown by his son Zeus and his siblings, who became the Olympian gods. With that kind of provenance, â\x80\x9cGeorgeâ\x80\x99s Starâ\x80\x9d didnâ\x80\x99t stand a chance. ', ""William Herschel would go on to discover more than 2500 nebulae, coin the word asteroid, and invent several new telescopes. But he didn't do it alone: Supporting him in every scientific effort was his younger sister Caroline, who tirelessly polished his telescope mirrors, stayed up all night to record celestial observations, and edited and published his groundbreaking star catalogs. Her own list of achievements is extensive. Caroline Herschel described 14 new nebulae, assembled a catalog of star clusters, and discovered eight comets, among other firsts.

30,What's the Difference Between Moths and Butterflies? ,"['animals', 'biology', 'insects', 'nature', 'news', 'the difference', '2024SEOclean']","['Butterflies and moths have a lot in common. Both species are insects, they both start life as caterpillars, and they both sport large, lustrous wings. But there are also clear scientific differences that separate the twoâ\x80\x94and you donâ\x80\x99t need to be an entomologist to recognize them.', 'Moths and butterflies look and behave so similarly because they comprise the same order of insects. Organisms in the order Lepidoptera are defined by their scaled wings and the straw-like mouthparts they use to sip fluids. They are born as larvae with segmented bodies and chewing mouthparts and undergo metamorphosis to reach their mature forms.', 'When a Lepidoptera caterpillar has entered its pupa stage, it will emerge as a creature that falls under one of two umbrellas: moth or butterfly. Moths can generally be recognized by their antennae. Unlike butterflies, which have long, skinny antennae that get wider at the tips, moth antennae have rows of hair-like bristles like feathers.', 'If you canâ\x80\x99t see the antennae of the insect youâ\x80\x99re looking at, check its wings. The wings of moths and butterflies bear some key differences, though theyâ\x80\x99re both large and shiny. Moth wings have a structure that butterflies lack called a frenulum, which connects the front and back sections of the wings together. When butterflies close their wings, they bring them together above their backs like the pages of a book, and when moths close them, they fold them straight back like a paper fan. Color can be a distinguishing factorâ\x80\x94butterflies like monarchs and swallowtails have brightly colored wings, while moths tend to be colored with duller shades like browns and creamsâ\x80\x94but that doesnâ\x80\x99t always confirm whether a creature is a moth or a butterfly. Some moth species, like the luna and rosy maple moth, display strikingly vibrant color patterns.', 'Their differences donâ\x80\x99t end with appearances. The time of day these animals can be seen out and about indicates which type of lepidopteran they are. While most butterflies are diurnal, meaning theyâ\x80\x99re active during the day, moths tend to be nocturnal. Without bright sunlight to fly by, moths evolved to use the moon to navigate, which is why the insects are attracted to bright light sources like porch lights and campfires.', 'In summary: If you canâ\x80\x99t tell if the thing flapping its wings in front of you is a moth or butterfly, check its wings, antennae, and the time of day.

This could very well spell doom for Morseâ\x80\x99s entire endeavor.', 'â\x80\x9c[I]f, by any means, the bill should fail in the Senate, I shall return to New York, with the fraction of a dollar in my pocket,â\x80\x9d Morse had recently written to his associate Alfred Vail. Eventually, one of his senator pals told him it was basically impossible that theyâ\x80\x99d get to his bill, and the dejected inventor withdrew to his hotel for the night.', 'So you can imagine his astonishment when, upon entering the breakfast room the next day, he was called to the parlor, where a smiling Annie Ellsworth congratulated him on his triumph. Annie was the teenage daughter of Henry L. Ellsworth, the commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office who had helped Morse secure a patent for his telegraph in 1837. After Morse had thrown in the towel the night before, Henry had stayed and watched the Senate pass his friendâ\x80\x99s pivotal bill with minutes to spare.

Hereâ\x80\x99s some amazing trivia about these red planet whirlwinds. Â\xa0', 'The amount of dust on Mars puts the nooks and crannies under your furniture to shame. Millions of years of weathering by strong, ceaseless winds eroded the Red Planetâ\x80\x99s rocks and surface layers and created a coat of extremely fine dust particlesâ\x80\x94up to 10 times finer than baby powder. Without bodies of water to trap airborne particles, Marsâ\x80\x99s dust continually drifts and swirls around  in its thin atmosphere, and often twists into dust devils.', 'For those unfamiliar with Earth-based dust devils, check out this footage taken in Ontario, Canada, back in 2007. This oneâ\x80\x99s actually on the smaller side, though. ', 'On our own planet, dust devils are dust-filled whirlwinds that are created via strong surface heating. They can range from 10 to 300 feet in diameter and between 500 to 1000 feet in height. Dust devils are usually smaller and much less intense than tornadoes, and they also tend to form on clear days, after the ground has absorbed a lot of heat from the sun. ', 'Like those on Earth, Martian dust devils form from solar energy. As warm air on the ground mixes with descending columns of cooler air, it creates an updraft and pulls dust into a vortex. But Martian dust devils are gigantic. NASA photographed one in 2012 after it reached the impressive stature of 12 miles tall. In addition to being much larger than Earthâ\x80\x99s dust devils, the Martian versions are more likely to occur in Marsâ\x80\x99s spring and summer seasons. ', 'Martian dust devils were discovered in the late 1970s. NASAâ\x80\x99s Viking orbiters, launched in 1975 and 1976, captured an array of photographs of the mysterious planet, some of which showcased its awe-inspiring dust devils and confirmed their existence. ', 'The tracks left by Martian dust devils resemble dark squiggles and slashes on the planetâ\x80\x99s surface. These filament-like lines are dark because dust devils blow away the lighter-toned soil that usually covers the basalt or lava bedrock, exposing the darker ground beneath. These tracks can linger for weeks or even months, depending on when new dust stormsâ\x80\x94or Martian dust devilsâ\x80\x94blow soil back over them.', 'NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey are improving their capacity to anticipate dust devils, a key part of protecting future astronauts on the Red Planet.', 'While scientists donâ\x80\x99t fully understand how Martian dust becomes airborne, they believe seasons can play a part. Most dust storms tend to coincide with the planetâ\x80\x99s southern hemisphere summer. Winds may be stronger in certain areas of the planet at that time of year, but the region itself and the shape of the land may also be factors. ', 'â\x80\x9cWe found that the places that had the strongest winds never retained enough dust to really produce a lot of dust storms,â\x80\x9d Claire Newman, lead author of a 2022 study on Martian atmospheric dynamics, told Space.com. â\x80\x9cBut the places that produced an average amount of wind, there was dust coming and going from them, because it had enough time to get redeposited and then lifted up.â\x80\x9d', 'Martian dust devils play a big role in how much dust spreads on the planet, however. â\x80\x9cA local dust storm might raise much more dust than the dust devils and surface gust winds, but local dust storms are short-lived, while dust devils and surface gusts result in sustained dust content,â\x80\x9d Ricardo Hueso, a physicist at the Universidad del PaÃ\xads Vasco (UPV/EHU) and co-author of the study, told Space.com.

The urn-shaped device featured several sculpted dragons, each with a ball in its mouth; one dragon dropped its ball into the mouth of one of several sculpted toads depending on the direction a tremor emerged from.', 'Seismological instruments had come a long way by the time British geologist John Milne invented the modern seismograph in the 1880s. The Richter scale was developed in 1935.

Here are 10 of the most powerful quakes to shake the world.', 'January 26, 1700, at 9 p.m. Pacific Time marks the moment for one of the largest earthquakes in the continental U.S. The precise time is known thanks to Japanâ\x80\x99s centuries-long practice of recording tsunamis (which began in 684 CE).', 'When Japan caught the arrival of the orphan tsunamiâ\x80\x94one that appears without a locally felt disturbanceâ\x80\x94observers calculated its point of origin as the Cascadia margin, an area 70 to 100 miles off the coasts of northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia where the Juan de Fuca and North American tectonic plates meet. Modern seismologists have estimated its magnitude at or above 9. The event occurred along a subduction zone, where one tectonic plate thrusts underneath another, pushing down into Earthâ\x80\x99s mantle. Those qualities classify it as a megathrust quake.', 'Oregon and Washingtonâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cghost forestsâ\x80\x9d provide more evidence of the event. These still-standing stumps were swamped by saltwater during initial flooding, followed by the land itself subsiding by up to 36 feet. First Nations living on the coast of Vancouver Island also help tell the tale: Their oral histories describe the destruction of low-lying settlements. Scientists say thereâ\x80\x99s a 37 percent chance that a megathrust above a magnitude of 7 will happen in the Pacific Northwest within the next 50 years.', 'On the morning of November 1, 1755, when much of Portugalâ\x80\x99s population was in church for All Saintsâ\x80\x99 Day mass, an estimated 8.5 to 9.2 magnitude megathrust quake struck the country. The seismic source was a fault in the Atlantic seafloor where the North American, African, and Eurasian plates meet. Releasing an amount of energy roughly equivalent to 32,000 atomic bombs, the earthquake generated a tsunami with waves 20 feet high in Lisbon and 65 feet high in parts of Spain. Waves sped west for nearly 3800 miles to reach Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, and traveled east toward Algiers, 685 miles away. Scotlandâ\x80\x99s rivers rose, people in Finland felt the quakeâ\x80\x99s tremors, and lives were lost in Brazil.

The South American plate (the worldâ\x80\x99s smallest major plate, encompassing South America plus a portion of the Atlantic) collided with the Nazca plate along South Americaâ\x80\x99s west coast, creating a subduction zone that produced an 8.8 magnitude quake.', 'The earthquake spanned 300 to 370 miles, generating a 16-foot tsunami that affected areas as far away as Hawaii, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, California, and Japan. Waves collapsed buildings, unleashed landslides, and took out transportation routes. The death toll for this earthquake is estimated to be between 500 and 1500 people. It remains the most powerful quake to hit this region, though four subsequent earthquakes have happened in the years since, with the most recent one in 2016.', 'On November 4, 1952, a megathrust earthquake shattered a section of far eastern Russia along the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc.

Tsunamis following the temblor killed 124 of the 139 total victims.', 'Thousands of aftershocks rumbled for three weeks, with 11 on the first day registering a magnitude greater than 6.2. The continued tremors agitated the ground so that it behaved more like a liquid, leading to landslides, spreading, and settling. One such landslide in Anchorage damaged 30 blocks of homes and commercial buildings, with water, gas, sewer, and power lines also destroyed. Some areas were permanently elevated or diminished by the upheaval: the coastline near Kodiak was raised 30 feet higher, while Girdwood, closer to Anchorage, dropped by about eight feet.', 'Striking on December 26, 2004, this catastrophic quake began off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

Another result of the Nazca plate/South America plate boundary, this megathrust was the largest Chilean earthquake since 1960. Helpfully, in the aftermath of the earlier Valdivia event, officials had established a stronger building code that saved lives. Disaster awareness and preparations had also improved in the intervening years.', 'The Maule quake killed about 570 people, comparatively fewer than other major quakes despite its power: The temblor was felt in six of the countryâ\x80\x99s regions where 80 percent of the population lives.

Much of the destruction centered on Sendai, the capital of the Tohoku region. Waves more than 130 feet high crushed buildings, roads, and railways and left approximately 450,000 people without homes. Of the 18,000 people killed, thousands were simply washed out to sea. Their bodies were never recovered.', 'Finally, the tsunami broke the power supply and cooling system of the three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, causing a meltdown that released radiation.

Most species belong to the genus Sphyrna (Greek for â\x80\x9chammerâ\x80\x9d), while anotherâ\x80\x94an oddball known as the winghead sharkâ\x80\x94is the sole member of its own genus, Eusphyra.

Hammerheads also vary in terms of overall size: The smaller species max out at 3 to 5 feet in length, while the biggest is the great hammerhead, which can be up to 18 feet long and weigh over 1000 pounds (with 10 to 13 feet and 500 pounds being closer to average).', 'The great hammerhead is threatened by the shark fin trade and bycatch (unwanted fish captured as a byproduct of commercial fishing). The winghead population is declining due to overfishing and net entanglement. And in 2014, the scalloped hammerhead became the first shark to ever receive protection from the U.S. Endangered Species Act.', 'In 2010, geneticists at the University of Colorado, Boulder compared DNA samples from eight hammerhead species in an attempt to map out the familyâ\x80\x99s evolutionary history. The molecular evidence suggested that the hammerheads started to diversify around 20 million years ago. The fossil record tells us sharks have existed for at least 420 million yearsâ\x80\x94so if the University of Colorado team is correct, hammerheads are relative newcomers. What did the earliest hammerheads look like? According to the researchers, they were probably large-bodied animals. They also argued that todayâ\x80\x99s modestly-sized bonnethead and winghead sharks independently evolved from big ancestors.', 'The sharksâ\x80\x99 broad, flat, hammer-shaped heads are called â\x80\x9ccephalofoils,â\x80\x9d and no other creature in the world has a head quite like it. Hammerheads, like all other sharks, have sensory organs that can detect the electric fields of prey in the water; some scientists hypothesize that the broad cephalofoils allow hammerheads to have more of these organsâ\x80\x94therefore allowing them to better sense prey. A 2002 experiment seemingly lent credence to this notion. Although the researchers didnâ\x80\x99t find a difference in sensitivity to the electric fields between a hammerhead and a cone-nosed sandbar shark, the hammerhead was able to search a larger area, which the researchers said would â\x80\x9cincrease the probability of prey-encounter.â\x80\x9d The researchers also noted that the hammerhead was more maneuverable than the sandbar shark.', 'A typical shark has eight fins on its body, the most recognizable is the first dorsal finâ\x80\x94it typically acts like a sailboat keel, helping the shark stay balanced while it swims. Sharks also have a pair of pectoral fins, located on either side of the body just behind the head, which most species use to steer and generate lift. In the majority of sharks, the pectoral fins are longer than the first dorsalâ\x80\x94but for great hammerheads, the opposite is true. And that has a big effect on how these animals move. A 2016 tagging study attached GoPro cameras to five great hammerheads that were living out in the wild. While being monitored, the sharks spent 90 percent of their swimming time tilted to one sideâ\x80\x94usually at an angle of 50 to 75 degrees. Why did they do this? Itâ\x80\x99s thought that after a hammerhead rolls sideways, the creatureâ\x80\x99s first dorsal fin acts like one of the pectoral fins. This reduces drag while also increasing the animalâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cwingspan.â\x80\x9d Both factors enable the shark to swim more efficiently.', 'The bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) is a small hammerhead that frequents warm, shallow waters. It hunts crabs and shrimpâ\x80\x94and sometimes it also ingests seagrass. One survey compared the gut contents of numerous wild bonnetheads and found that up to 62 percent of all the organic matter discovered in their stomachs was seagrass. And in a 2017 experiment, captive bonnetheads were fed a 90 percent seagrass diet. Rather than waste away, the sharks gained weight. A feces analysis showed that the sharks were digesting half of the grass theyâ\x80\x99d been eating; enzymes designed to break down plant matter are present in the bonnetheadâ\x80\x99s digestive tract. Experts arenâ\x80\x99t sure if the sharks go out of their way to eat seagrass or just swallow it accidentally while hunting small animals. Either way, the bonnethead now qualifies as the only omnivorous shark known to science.', 'If a stingray is found just above the ocean floor, a hungry great hammerhead will use its cephalofoil to pin the creature against the sand. Then, with a bite to the pectoral fin (or â\x80\x9cwingâ\x80\x9d), the prey is immobilized. But the shark doesnâ\x80\x99t always escape unscathed: Great hammerheads are often found with stingray barbs on their faces.', 'In 2009, biologist Michelle McComb and her team captured live bonnetheads, winghead sharks, and scalloped hammerheads to test their vision. They attached recording devices right below the sharksâ\x80\x99 corneas and monitored the fishesâ\x80\x99 eye movements while sweeping light beams across their faces. The researchers found that the binocular overlap in the hammerheadsâ\x80\x99 field of vision is up to three times higher than it is in lemon and blacknose sharksâ\x80\x94both of which have cone-shaped snouts. That means hammerheads have superior depth perception when compared to other sharks.', 'Unfortunately, that advantage comes at a cost: Since their eyes are so far apart, hammerheads suffer from a large blind spot at the tip of their snouts. As McComb told National Geographic, â\x80\x9c[There have] actually been anecdotal claims by divers that they see little fish schooling right in front of the hammerheadsâ\x80\x99 heads. Itâ\x80\x99s like the fish are swimming by and saying, Ha, ha, ha, you canâ\x80\x99t see me!â\x80\x9d', 'In 2001, a bonnethead was born inside one of the aquariums at Omahaâ\x80\x99s Henry Doorly Zoo. The birth came as a complete surprise to the staff because all the bonnetheads in that tank were femalesâ\x80\x94and none had seen a male of their species in three years. At first, it seemed likely that the mother must have been storing sperm; females of many animal species can keep semen alive for years before using it to fertilize eggs. But testing confirmed that Omahaâ\x80\x99s baby bonnethead had no paternal DNA; the mother had reproduced by fertilizing her own egg cells, a phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. It had never been documented in sharks before.', 'Though many sharks are solitary creatures, scalloped hammerheadsâ\x80\x94which can reach lengths of 10 to 12 feet and can weigh in at 300 pounds or moreâ\x80\x94form schools. The young sharks probably travel in schools for mutual protection, but nobody knows why full-grown scalloped hammerheads, which have few natural predators, congregate like this. The behavior may have something to do with their migration patterns or mating habits. Some schools are exclusively made up of females while others contain sharks of both sexes and different ages. In adults-only groups, the fish tend to disperse at night before meeting back up during the day.', 'The scalloped hammerhead isnâ\x80\x99t the only species that creates schools: The smooth hammerhead also travels in groups.', 'Relative to its body size, the winghead shark has the widest head of any hammerheadâ\x80\x94almost half as wide as its body is long. Wingheads live in the Indo-Pacific, where their oddly-shaped heads make them prone to getting tangled up in fishing nets.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s a myth that sharks donâ\x80\x99t get cancer, but young scalloped hammerheads appear to develop cancer-free suntans. Researchers noticed that when young scalloped hammerheads are kept in shallow outdoor pools, their skin darkened, going from a light beige to a rich chocolate brown. To figure out what was happening, the scientists put opaque filters on their sharksâ\x80\x99 pectoral fins. These partly blocked ultraviolet light, leaving the skin under the filter paler than the skin that had been exposed to the sun. â\x80\x9cOur experiments demonstrated that the sharks were truly suntanning and that the response was, in fact, induced by the increase in solar radiation,â\x80\x9d the scientists said in a press release. â\x80\x9cThese sharks increased the melanin content in their skin by 14 percent over 21 days, and up to 28 percent over 215 days.â\x80\x9d Despite all the tanning theyâ\x80\x99d done, there wasnâ\x80\x99t a trace of skin cancer on any of the test sharks.

Leona Marshall Libby had a more pressing concern: How to disguise her pregnancy.', 'In her early twenties, Libby was part of an elite team assembled by Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. Their work would inform the eventual assembly of the nationâ\x80\x99s first atomic bomb, the deployment of which would bring a hastened end to World War II. For Libby, the responsibility was compounded by the fact that she was fresh out of college. Of the 41 members of Fermiâ\x80\x99s team, she was also the only woman scientist; and now she was pregnant, a condition that in the 1940s often meant being involuntarily removed from employment.', 'Not wishing to be distanced from the most important work of her life, Libby buried her increasingly distended stomach in bulky clothes, keeping it a secret from almost everyone. Each day, she went in looking for breakthroughs that would spare lives in war, sometimes at the risk of her own. And at the end of it all, she would wonder if helping to create the most formidable weapon of mass destruction yet conceived was a noble actâ\x80\x94or one that that humanity would come to regret.', 'Leona Marshall Libby was born Leona Woods in Proviso, Illinois, in 1919, the daughter of Weightstill Woods, a lawyer, and Mary Holderness Woods, a teacher and potter. Academia seemed a likely path: She graduated high school at the age of 14 and had earned a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry at the University of Chicago at age 19.', 'As Libby worked on her doctoral thesis and pursued a joint fellowship in physics and chemistry, Pearl Harbor was attacked. The assault forced the United States to make a formal entry into World War II by declaring war on Japan on December 8, 1941. With that came a concurrent need to hasten U.S. progress in the secret nuclear arms race with Germany. Americaâ\x80\x99s best and brightest, including J. Robert Oppenheimer, were recruited for the Manhattan Project to research and ultimately build an atomic weapon. Officials hoped that the mere existence of such a weapon would deter and ultimately defeat the Axis Powers.', 'The project was not centralized in any one location but across many institutions and groups. Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist, was associated with Libbyâ\x80\x99s own University of Chicago. His mission: to create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, a key building block in the development of the bomb.', ""By this time, Libby had earned her doctorate, and her credentials made her an easy pick, though her gender and age (23) didnâ\x80\x99t make her an obvious one. As with many professions in this era, men often looked askance at women as peers. And women were certainly in the minority: They made up roughly 11 percent of Oppenheimer's Los Alamos workforce, and about half of them were scientists."", 'Physicist Anne McKusick, who worked at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, laboratory (which enriched uranium for the Los Alamos crew), recalled, â\x80\x9cWhen I got to Oak Ridge, it was perhaps not surprising that there were no girls who were physicists â\x80¦ It was just that women werenâ\x80\x99t thought to be capable of learning the subject, or thought that it was strictly a manâ\x80\x99s field at that time.â\x80\x9d', 'Libby had no such thoughts. In fact, she appeared brimming with confidence. Fermi once asked how she felt about a book he had authored about thermodynamics. Itâ\x80\x99s a good baby book, she said, as though he had written a decent beginnerâ\x80\x99s guide on the subject.', 'Libby joined the University of Chicago team at the metallurgical lab in August 1942 for the purpose of developing a boron trifluoride counter, which could detect neutrons vital to the chain reaction. In addition to being complex, the work had the added stress of being potentially hazardous. Once, after being exposed to gamma rays, Libby was informed her white blood cell count had dropped by half. Physicians warned her further exposure could potentially affect her fertility. It was salient advice: Libby was newly married to John Marshall, a fellow chemist and Manhattan Project recruit, and they were planning to start a family.', 'Because Fermi and his team didnâ\x80\x99t have explicit knowledge of how much progress German nuclear scientists had made with their weaponâ\x80\x94as far as Fermi knew, it was possible they had already developed a human-generated nuclear chain reactionâ\x80\x94they worked at incredible speed. In the fall of 1942, they slowly built up what would be known as Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1), a towering, 20-foot-tall construction that was assembled from graphite blocks and uranium. If done properly, the construct should be able to release a controlled amount of energy, with uranium atoms split by neutrons. That would result in more neutrons, which would in turn split more of the atoms. Scaled up, the energy would result in a bomb of previously unimaginable destructive power. Day in and day out, Libby hefted graphite blocks, getting the sooty dust all over her face and hands. It was the graphite that would keep things controlled.', 'For the CP-1 experiment, Fermi, Libby, and the team didnâ\x80\x99t want to immolate themselves: They merely wanted to prove such a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible. Finally, on December 2, 1942, almost one year to the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the scientists gathered on an old squash court at the University of Chicago and observed their achievement: a tower made of roughly 40,000 blocks of graphite and uranium, each the size of a large loaf of bread. The uranium used had low amounts of fissionable isotopes, which meant, in theory, the experiment could demonstrate the reaction without causing a massive explosion.', 'In theory.', 'One by one, the control rods plated with cadmium to control the reaction were removed. As Libby and others watched and took readings over the next few hours, CP-1 began reacting. Nearby, a few men stood ready with a neutron-absorbing material in the event things went awry. Then CP-1 went critical, creating the first human self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Though it released only about a half-watt of energyâ\x80\x94perhaps enough to fuel a flashlightâ\x80\x94it was lighting the fuse that would ultimately transform nuclear capabilities.', 'â\x80\x9cIt was a day that had been building up for many months,â\x80\x9d she later recalled. â\x80\x9cIt was excitingâ\x80\x94not a happy birthday kind of excitement, but the quiet excitement of a physics experiment.â\x80\x9d', 'Later, a bottle of Chianti was passed around to celebrate. Libby, like all team members, wound up signing the bottle. She was the only woman to witness an event that would lead directly to the end of the war.', 'Following the teamâ\x80\x99s success in Chicago, Libby moved on to Hanford, Washington, where the Hanford Engineer Works was producing plutonium for the Los Alamos operations (a chain reaction large enough to fuel an atomic bomb needed a lot of plutonium). Again, Libby was the only woman physicist. She was a â\x80\x9creactor babysitter,â\x80\x9d watching for signs of trouble as part of a 24-hour shift. She took days; her husband, John, took nights. In a concession to her status as the lone woman, the facilityâ\x80\x99s supervisors installed a ladiesâ\x80\x99 bathroom.', 'It was in Hanford that Libby became pregnant. Not wishing to pause her work, she kept her pregnancy from her supervisor and from her colleagues right up until she left to go into labor.', 'After a weekâ\x80\x99s maternity leave following the birth of her son, Peter, she returned to work in Hanford and to the plutonium. In 1944, the reactor suddenly lost power, which Libby and colleague John Wheeler were able to diagnose as being the result of xenon poisoning, a byproduct that polluted the process. Once identified, Hanford scientists were able to resolve the issue.', 'Their preliminary work made the bomb possible: The Trinity test, conducted on July 15, 1945, demonstrated the atomic bomb was viable. It was also proof the work of Libby and the other project scientists had been successful in making a radical advancement in weaponry in a compressed period of time.', 'Libby was not in New Mexico for the test of the bomb, though Fermi was. Nor did Libby work directly with Oppenheimer during the development of the bomb. The two knew each other, however. In 1979â\x80\x99s The Uranium People, Libbyâ\x80\x99s account of the work, she related a story in which a parlor game was being played at a party and each person was asked who else theyâ\x80\x99d like to be for a day. Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s answer was Fermi. (Libby fancied being Hollywood star Greta Garbo.)', ""The world soon learned the full impact of the Manhattan Projectâ\x80\x99s creation. The bomb was used to devastating effect over Hiroshima, killing over 80,000 people immediately and subjecting tens of thousands more to the insidious effects of radiation. The bomb deployed over Nagasaki caused another 40,000 casualties, prompting Japan's surrender within days and effectively ending the war. The plutonium consolidated in Hanford was used in the bomb that detonated in Nagasaki."", 'Although Libby didnâ\x80\x99t seek the spotlight for her contributions, she was still singled out. Mademoiselle, a popular womenâ\x80\x99s magazine of the era, anointed her one of their Women of the Year in 1946. A decade later, The Chicago Tribune declared her â\x80\x9cone of the nationâ\x80\x99s half-dozen top-flight woman physicists.""', 'Her stature in the field led to a series of high-profile positions at numerous institutions, including fellowships at the University of Chicago and Princeton (where she worked with Oppenheimer), professor at New York University, and visiting professor of environmental studies and engineering at UCLA. She and John Marshall divorced; Libby became Leona Libby after remarrying in 1967.', ""Throughout her life, she was a champion of nuclear power and its potential to benefit humanity. Some decades later, she was asked about the ramifications of her work and whether it weighed on her mind as it had other members of the Manhattan Project, some of whom had unsuccessfully petitioned for the U.S. to threaten adversaries with the bomb's existence rather than actually deploy it. The interview, which was conducted shortly before her death in 1986, provided an unequivocal response."", 'â\x80\x9cIt was pretty clear the war would continue, with half a million of our fighting men dead[,] not to say how many Japanese,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9cI have no regrets. I think we did right, and we couldnâ\x80\x99t have done it differently. Yeah, I know it has been suggested the second bomb, Nagasaki, was not necessary. The guys who cry on shoulders.

But what allows owls to fly so quietly, when other birds can be heard flapping and fluttering from far away?', 'According to Gizmodo, aÂ\xa0group of researchers decided to answer that question, and their experiment appears in the short BBC Earth video below. Using sensitive sound equipment, the BBC Earth team recorded the sounds of a pigeon, a peregrine falcon, and a barn owl, all in flight. Then, they filmed each bird flying over a pile of feathers to study how their wings disturbed the airâ\x80\x94and the feathersâ\x80\x94beneath them. They found that differences in sound came down to each birdâ\x80\x99s proportions: The pigeon, for instance, has small wings in relation to its body, forcing it to flap desperately to stay in flight. The owl, meanwhile, supports its small body with relatively large wings, allowing it to glide further on a single wingstroke, creating less air turbulence.', 'â\x80\x9cThe barn owl is far more graceful,â\x80\x9d the video explains. â\x80\x9cJust one gentle wingbeat sees her gliding effortlessly through the air, creating little more than a whisper in the feathers below.â\x80\x9d ', 'It isnâ\x80\x99t just wing proportion that allows owls to move silently.

The soft textures of the other owl feathers muffle the sound further until virtually all of the audible noise is absorbed.

At night, when raccoons are most active, less peripheral light makes it easier for them to perceive contrast in the objects of their focus, which is essential for seeing in the dark.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s unusual for White House pets to start as Thanksgiving dinner, but that was the case with Rebecca, the raccoon that lived with Calvin Coolidge for part of his presidency. At the time, raccoon meat wasnâ\x80\x99t a terribly uncommon sight on dinner tables in America. But once he met the live critter, Coolidge decided he was more interested in adopting her than having her for supper. ', 'Rebecca soon became part of the family, receiving an engraved collar for Christmas, taking part in the annual Easter Egg Roll, and frequently accompanying the president on walks around the White House grounds. Having a wild animal in the White House may sound absurd by todayâ\x80\x99s standards, but considering Coolidgeâ\x80\x99s pets at the time also included a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby, Rebecca fit right in.', 'The first raccoons were exported to Europe in the 1920s to stock fur farms. By way of an accidental bombing and some bored farmers just wanting to spice up the local wildlife, many raccoons escaped and founded a new population in the wild. Today, raccoons in Europe are considered an invasive species.', 'The animals even ended up in Japan. Their journey there had more wholesome beginnings: In the 1970s, Japanese children were obsessed with the cuddly star of the anime cartoon Rascal the Raccoon. Kids demanded pet raccoons of their own, and at one point Japan was importing roughly 1500 of them a month. ', 'Naturally, many of these pets ended up back in the wild when they grew too big for families to take care of them properly. Japan has since prohibited importing and owning raccoons, but the descendants of that initial boom have spread to 42 of the countryâ\x80\x99s 47 prefectures.', 'Raccoons are among the rare species that have actually benefited from the spread of humans. Populations in North America have skyrocketed in the past several decades, and this is despite the destruction of much of the animalsâ\x80\x99 natural environment. ', 'Raccoons are adaptable enough to thrive in rural, urban, and suburban environments. In the forests, raccoons will eat birds, insects, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while in residential areas theyâ\x80\x99ll scavenge for garbage and pet food. Some raccoons do their foraging in human-populated areas, then retreat into the woods during the day to sleep. Others make buildingsâ\x80\x94both abandoned and occupiedâ\x80\x94their home.', 'Raccoons are regarded by scientists as intelligent creatures, but city dwellers may notice that their local specimens reach special levels of cunning. ', 'This may be because urban raccoons are forced to outsmart human-made obstacles on a regular basis. When Suzanne MacDonald, a psychologist and biologist at York University in Toronto, outfitted city raccoons with GPS collars, she discovered that they had learned to avoid major intersections. ', 'A second experiment supported the theory that raccoons accustomed to life around humans are better equipped to solve unconventional problems. MacDonald planted garbage cans containing food in urban and rural areas. When it came to opening the tricky lid, most city raccoons could figure it out while the country raccoons failed each time.', 'In the early 20th century, raccoons were poised to become the go-to model for animal experiments. They were some of the most curious and intelligent animals available, scientists believed, so that meant they were an obvious choice for comparative psychology studies. ', 'Though raccoons were the subject of several psychology experiments at the turn of the century, they didnâ\x80\x99t stick around in labs for long. Unlike rats, they were hard to breed and maintain in large numbers. They also had the pesky tendencies to chew through their cages, pickpocket researchers, and hide out in air vents. Despite one researcherâ\x80\x99s plan to breed a tamer strain of raccoon, the creatureâ\x80\x99s future in the lab never took off.', 'While most animals use either sight, sound, or smell to hunt, raccoons rely on their sense of touch to locate goodies. Their front paws are incredibly dexterous and contain roughly four times more sensory receptors than their back pawsâ\x80\x94about the same ratio of human hands to feet. This allows them to differentiate between objects without seeing them, which is crucial when feeding at night.', 'Raccoons can heighten their sense of touch through an act called dousing. To humans, this can look like the animals are washing their food, but what theyâ\x80\x99re really doing is wetting their paws to stimulate the nerve endings. Like light to a humanâ\x80\x99s eyes, water on a raccoonâ\x80\x99s hands gives it more sensory information to work with, allowing it to feel more than it would otherwise.', 'Give raccoons a puzzle and, as long as thereâ\x80\x99s food involved, theyâ\x80\x99ll usually find a way to solve it. Theyâ\x80\x99ve not only proven this time and time again in yards and campsites but in labs as well. In the early 1900s, ethologist H.B. Davis gave 12 raccoons a series of locks to crack. To access the treats inside the boxes, they had to navigate hooks, bolts, buttons, latches, and levers, with some boxes featuring more than one lock. In the end, the raccoons were able to get past 11 of the 13 mechanisms.', 'More recently in 2017, scientists tasked a group of raccoons with the Aesopâ\x80\x99s Fable test. The classic story, which tells of a crow dropping stones into a pitcher to get its water level to rise, has been adapted by researchers as a standard for animal intelligence. Raccoons were placed in a room with a cylinder of water with marshmallows floating on the surface and stones scattered around it. To reach the sugary snacks, they first had to make the water higher by depositing the stones. After they were shown what to do, two out of eight raccoons copied the behavior, while a third took an unexpected approach to the problem and toppled the whole thing over.', 'A version of this article was originally published in 2018 and has been updated for 2024.', 'manual', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/527175/10-clever-facts-about-raccoons
43,8 Safety Tips for Watching the 2024 Solar Eclipse,"['lists', 'space', 'nature', 'look up!', 'eclipse', 'astronomy', 'Moon', 'NASA']","['North America is busy preparing for the next total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. Viewers in the path of totalityâ\x80\x94which stretches from Sinaloa in Mexico to Newfoundland in Canadaâ\x80\x94will be treated to up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds of uninterrupted darkness when the moon fully covers the sun. If you donâ\x80\x99t live within the path, or you donâ\x80\x99t feeling like braving the traffic to get there, a partial solar eclipse will still be visible throughout much of the contiguous U.S. (weather permitting). But enjoying it wonâ\x80\x99t be as easy as stepping into your backyard and looking up. If youâ\x80\x99ve forgotten the protocol since the last great American eclipse in 2017, here are some important safety tips to keep in mind.Â\xa0', 'Hopefully you already know the No.1 rule of eclipse safety: Never stare directly at the sun without the proper safety equipment. Even when our solar systemâ\x80\x99s star is mostly covered, a sliver of radiation peeking past the moon is still enough to cause permanent damage to your retinas. This area in the back of the eyes is extremely sensitive to light, and direct exposure to ultraviolet rays can lead to scarring and a condition called â\x80\x9csolar retinopathy.â\x80\x9d Even if it doesnâ\x80\x99t blind you fully, this type of injury can leave you with gray and blurry patches in your vision for the rest of your life.', 'The majority of the moonâ\x80\x99s journey across the sun can only be viewed with special equipment. UV-filtering eclipse glasses are a popular option, as they provide the clearest look at the event leading up to totality. There will be a lot of subpar products flooding the market ahead of April 8, though. When shopping for a pair, be sure to look for the code ISO 12312-2; this indicates that they meet international safety standards. NASA doesnâ\x80\x99t endorse any specific brand, so be wary of companies that claim theyâ\x80\x99re approved by the association. The American Astronomical Society has a list of recommended manufacturers on its website. Before wearing your glasses, check for issues like scratches and loose lenses. Damaged equipment may not work properly and could end up injuring your vision.', 'The one exception to the No.1 eclipse viewing rule comes during the few minutes of totality when the moon fully covers the sunâ\x80\x94and you need to be in the path of totality when this occurs. During this brief window, itâ\x80\x99s safe to remove your viewing equipment and looking straight in the direction of the sun. Just be sure that totality has actually arrived before taking a look (and if you canâ\x80\x99t tell, it hasnâ\x80\x99t happened yet). The moment you notice the sunâ\x80\x99s light return, look away and put your viewing glasses back on. You can check when totality will occur in many North American cities here.', 'An alternative to solar viewing glasses is an old-fashioned pinhole projector. This allows you to indirectly view the event by casting the sunâ\x80\x99s eclipsed light through a small hole and onto a flat surface. NASA has instructions for building an eclipse projector box on its website. If you arenâ\x80\x99t able to DIY a viewing tool, the holes of a colander and even the gaps between a treeâ\x80\x99s leaves can act as pinhole cameras during an eclipse. When using this method, always take care to look at the shadows the moon casts on the ground while keeping your back toward the sun.Â\xa0', 'Your eyes arenâ\x80\x99t the only part of your body vulnerable to the sunâ\x80\x99s rays. Standing beneath the sun for a prolonged period is just as likely to damage your skin on the day of an eclipse as it is any other time. Practice your regular skin safety routine to avoid a nasty burn the next day. Applyâ\x80\x94and reapplyâ\x80\x94sunscreen to any exposed skin, including oft-neglected areas like ears, eyelids, and lips. A wide-brimmed hat and long-sleeved clothing can help provide extra coverage.Â\xa0', 'Even when viewed through the lenses of a telescope or binoculars, direct sunlight can still fry your retinas. If you plan on using magnifying equipment to see the event up close, youâ\x80\x99ll need to procure special filters ahead of time. Many manufacturers of certified eclipse glasses also produce UV-filtering caps for telescope and binocular lenses. These devices are made of mylar or glass, and as is the case with eclipse glasses, they should be checked for wear and tear before use. Avoid filters that screw directly into the eyepiece of your viewing equipment; they can easily overheat and crack after just a few seconds of pointing at the sun.Â\xa0', 'Towns in the path of totality are expecting a flood of visitors on April 8, and some have already declared a state of emergency in preparation. If you plan to be in the path of totality, you should also prepare for unprecedented levels of traffic. That means having a full tank of gas, any necessary medications, and plenty of snacks and water for the day. In addition to a cellphone, chargers, and an external battery, consider packing physical road maps. They could come in handy if cellular networks become overloaded during the exodus following totality [PDF]. It may be hard to find a viewing spot the day of, but resist pulling over on the side of a busy highway. Distracted eclipse viewers combined with fast-moving vehicles are a recipe for disaster. Instead, scope out an off-road site like a public parkâ\x80\x94or get in touch with that old friend who has a house in the path of totality. Make sure you leave early for the event and donâ\x80\x99t make plans for the rest of day, as youâ\x80\x99ll likely be spending it in on the road.Â\xa0', 'A solar eclipse is an exciting experience for young people, but it can be dangerous if they donâ\x80\x99t know the safety rules. Go over the protocol above with your children before and during the big event. Protective equipment like eclipse glasses should always be used with adult supervision. If your kids might be tempted to take off their glasses and sneak a peek at the sun, they probably shouldnâ\x80\x99t be looking in that direction with or without protection. Instead, stick to indirect viewing methods like pinhole projectors (building the box can be a fun activity on its own). ', 'If the only babies in your household are of the furry variety, donâ\x80\x99t worry about protecting them from the eclipse. Pets will treat the sun the same as on any other day, though they may get confused when it suddenly gets dark in the middle of the afternoon.

44,Solar Eclipse 2024: The Mental Floss Viewing Guide,"['astronomy', 'news', 'science', 'travel']","['A solar eclipse will darken skies over much of the United States on April 8, 2024, and if you want to catch it, you should start making preparations now. To see the total solar eclipse, you will need to travel to the path of totality. At the time of the last total solar eclipse over the U.S. in August 2017, Mental Floss spoke to Mitzi Adams, a heliophysicist at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, for everything you need to know about solar eclipsesâ\x80\x94from photographing the process, to why scientists study eclipses, to how animals react when day turns to night.', 'During a total solar eclipse, the moon moves between Earth and the sun and obscures the sun completely.', ""A total solar eclipse is made up of phases. First, there's initial contact, when the sun and moon first â\x80\x9ctouch.â\x80\x9d This leads into the partial phase, when it looks like someone is taking increasingly large bites from the sun. Next is the actual eclipse itself, when the sun is totally covered by the moon. It lasts a very brief time, from a few seconds to just over two minutes, depending on where along the path of totality you view it. The sun passes through partial phases again as the moon continues on its way. During the total phase, when it is safe to briefly remove your eclipse glasses, behold the corona of the sunâ\x80\x94wispy, revenant limbs of light reaching from a black hole in the sky. Stars and planets will be visible as day has turned to an eerie, ethereal night."", ""As the eclipse moves through its phases, Adams said, you'll notice that nature has no idea what's going on. â\x80\x9cDuring the total phase when the light from the sun's photosphere is completely blocked, some animals react,â\x80\x9d she told Mental Floss. â\x80\x9cCrickets start chirping. Youâ\x80\x99ll hear frogs. Birds will go to roost. Chickens will react the same way they do at sunset. All animals, including the human ones, react to eclipses in some way. The human reaction is typically, â\x80\x98Wow! Look at that!â\x80\x98â\x80\x9d"", 'The 2024 solar eclipse has been dubbed the Great North American Eclipse because its path of totalityâ\x80\x94where day temporarily turns to nightâ\x80\x94stretches from the Pacific coast of Mexico, through the eastern half of the U.S., to eastern Canada. At approximately 11:07 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the eclipseâ\x80\x99s journey across the continent will begin at Mazatlan, Mexico, and follow a northeast direction through Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Finally, the eclipse will pass over New Brunswick and Newfoundland, Canada. You can find your closest location to the path of totality with this solar eclipse 2024 interactive map.', 'Total solar eclipses will occur near major U.S. cities during the afternoon of April 8, 2024, according to NASAâ\x80\x99s predictions.

If you don't wear solar eclipse glasses, you won't be able to see anything that's happening because you are staring at the sun. More importantly, you will also be at risk for permanent eye damage from the sunâ\x80\x99s ultraviolet rays. "", ""Eclipse glasses will not magnify the eclipse. You can, however, use a telescope or pair of binoculars if you want to get a closer look. You really need to know what you're doing, though, and if this is your first eclipse, ask yourself if it is worth fiddling with knobs during what might be a once-in-a-lifetime event. If you're going to use a telescope, Adams said, â\x80\x9cthe safest way is to have a special filter that will fit over the front of the telescope. The telescope could be a refractor or a reflector. Binoculars would also work, though you want either two filters, or one filter while you block the light over one side of the binocular pair. Any of these filters will fit over the front.â\x80\x9d"", ""The filters will be made of mylar or glass, she said, and warns that they must be specifically certified as safe for viewing the sun. â\x80\x9cYou do not want to use any kind of filter that will screw into an eyepiece because they will crack, and it doesn't take very longâ\x80\x94just a couple of secondsâ\x80\x94to build up the heat to crack the filter.â\x80\x9d"", 'If you want to view the sun up close during the partial phase of the eclipse, be on the lookout for sunspots, the darker areas seen on the surface of the sun. The current phase of the 11-year sunspot cycle suggests that there will be an good chance of seeing sunspots during the 2024 Great North American Eclipse.', 'If you are lucky enough to be in or near the 2024 eclipseâ\x80\x99s path of totality, look for free or inexpensive eclipse glasses at public viewing events, libraries, museums, and state parks. Eclipse glasses can be found online as well, but beware of counterfeit products from overseas. The American Astronomical Society recommends buying eclipse glasses made in the U.S. from its list of vetted manufacturers that comply with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard for solar filters.', 'The eyeglass retailer Warby Parker will also be giving away free eclipse glasses at all of its stores beginning April 1, 2024.', ""There are a lot of mistaken beliefs about eclipses that should be put to rest. â\x80\x9cOne large misconception is that somehow going outside during the eclipse is dangerousâ\x80\x94that there are somehow â\x80\x98eclipse raysâ\x80\x99 that happen, and that the sun is more dangerous during an eclipse,â\x80\x9d Adams said. â\x80\x9cThat's just not true. The light from the sun is exactly the same from an eclipse as when itâ\x80\x99s not eclipsed.â\x80\x9d"", 'Likewise, staring at an eclipse when it is at totality will not make you go blind. In fact, during totality, you can take off your eclipse glasses and stare at the moon-concealed sunâ\x80\x94but only when the sun is completely obscured by the moon, and even then, the organization Prevent Blindness recommends doing so with caution. You must put the glasses back on when the sun emerges from behind the moon after totality.', 'Nikon has provided a comprehensive guide to photographing the sun conventionally on a tripod as well as with a special telescope mount. The American Astronomical Society also has a useful set of pointers for how to preserve the moment. But the big thing to remember is to avoid using a flash (or a flashlight)â\x80\x94not for reasons related to photography, but because part of the wonder of the event is the day turning to night. Light pollution is already a problem for skywatching. The best photography advice might be to keep your camera at home and enjoy the total eclipse with your eyes safely behind a pair of eclipse glassesâ\x80\x94not through a glass screen.', ""â\x80\x9cWe want to learn as much about the sun as possible,â\x80\x9d Adams said. â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re trying to study from the core of sun all the way out to the corona, which is the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere. The eclipse will enable us to study the inner corona. We can actually build pictures of events on the sun from the photosphere, through the chromosphere, and into the corona.â\x80\x9d"", 'Scientists will combine the visible light images that they get from the eclipse with images from sources such as NASAâ\x80\x98s Solar Dynamics Observatory in orbit around Earth. The observatory views the sun in multiple wavelengthsâ\x80\x94mostly extreme ultravioletâ\x80\x94continuously, but it is unable to get the inner corona in visible light. â\x80\x9cWe canâ\x80\x99t really study the full spectrum unless weâ\x80\x99re using images from a solar eclipse,â\x80\x9d Adams said.', ""NASA and its institutional partners have numerous eclipse-related citizen science projects if youâ\x80\x99re interested in taking your observations to the next level. There's Citizen CATE, in which amateur astronomers across the country will use identical cameras and telescope equipment to take pictures of the sun's inner corona. The Eclipse Megamovie Project will use images and footage taken of the 2024 solar eclipse by citizen scientists across the country to stitch together a high-definition video of the eclipse. If you will be within the 2024 eclipse path of totality, you can sign up for Eclipse Soundscapes, a project that collects citizen scientistsâ\x80\x99 sound recordings of nature before, during, and after the eclipse to determine how â\x80\x9csolar eclipses affect life on Earth.â\x80\x9d"", ""Major U.S. cities in the 2024 eclipse path of totality include Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; Buffalo and Rochester, New York; and Burlington, Vermont. The path of totality will also skirt Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal in Canada. Those who want to catch a glimpse of totality in these cities should book their flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars post-haste. But there are plenty of other travel destination options: the path of totality crosses nearly the entire widths of Texas, Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio, and Maine, so smaller-scale hotels and AirBnBs away from big cities may be a good bet. Don't forget the possibility of camping in state or regional parks and public lands, many of which may be holding their own eclipse-related viewing events."", 'Traffic and parking may also pose problems, so make sure your gas tank is full, you have food and water in the car, and for the love of all that is good and holy, insist that the kids try to use the bathroom before you get on the highway. It might be a very long, very slow drive even for short distances.', 'The good news: Most of the communities along the path of totality are pulling out all the stops. While you wait for the (very brief) show, there will be plenty of entertainment, and NASA will have beachhead presence across the country with science demonstrations for kids and adults alike.

45,Bloody Mary: Why We Think We See Ghosts in Mirrors,"['brain', 'history', 'myths', 'science', 'news', 'origins', '2024SEOclean']","['One of the surest ways to prove your courage to all the other kids at a slumber party back in the day was to march into a dimly lit room (typically a bathroom), stare at your face in the mirror, and repeat the words â\x80\x9cBloody Maryâ\x80\x9d a specified number of times (typically three, though some versions say 13). According to legend, a woman would suddenly appear in the mirror and scratch your face offâ\x80\x94or perhaps even kill you. Different iterations of this game exist around the world; in one, the mysterious mirror woman goes by Mary Worth or Kathy, and in another, the devil himself makes an appearance.', 'Of course, no ghosts or demons ever actually appeared, but that didnâ\x80\x99t stop you from running out of the bathroom screaming, convinced that you saw a bloodied face looking back. Even as adults, our minds sometimes play tricks on us. We may get spooked after thinking we see something in the mirror while getting ready for work or brushing our teeth, even though we are rational beings and understand that nothing is there.', 'However, thereâ\x80\x99s a perfectly logical explanation for this. The longer you stare in a mirror, the more likely you are to start seeing things that arenâ\x80\x99t thereâ\x80\x94even if you havenâ\x80\x99t been forewarned that something ghastly will appear. This is partly due to a phenomenon called the Troxler effect. When you stare at the same object for a prolonged period of time, there comes a point when your brain adapts or gets used to unchanging stimuli. As a result, your neurons cancel the information out, and the image often appears blurry, faded, or distorted until you blink or look around.', 'Likewise, if you gaze into your own eyes in front of a mirror, your whole face will start to look strange if you look long enough. You can try this optical illusion out for yourselfâ\x80\x94no mirror needed.', 'Stare at the plus sign in the center of the image below for seven or eight seconds:', 'Did the colorful blotches fade to gray? This is just one of the many ways your brain can trick you and distort your vision. Itâ\x80\x99s actually an important coping mechanism, though. As Live ScienceÂ\xa0wrote, â\x80\x9cIf you couldnâ\x80\x99t ignore the steady hum of your computer monitor, the constant smell of your own body odor, or the nose jutting out in front of your face, youâ\x80\x99d never be able to focus on the important thingsâ\x80\x94like whether your boss is standing right behind you.â\x80\x9d', 'Another part of the phenomenon is the recently described â\x80\x9cstrange face in the mirrorâ\x80\x9d illusion. Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo conducted an experiment in 2010 in which people were asked to enter a dimly lit room and look at their reflection in the mirror for 10 minutes. Afterwards, they were asked to report what they saw. Of the 50 test subjects, 66 percent reported seeing â\x80\x9chuge deformationsâ\x80\x9d of their face, and 48 percent also saw â\x80\x9cfantastical and monstrous beings.â\x80\x9d Others described seeing the face of a parent (some of whom were deceased), the face of an animal, or the face of an old woman or child.', 'Humans in general have a remarkable ability to see faces in everyday objectsâ\x80\x94from clouds to trees to pieces of toastâ\x80\x94so it makes sense that dim lighting and visual tricks would cause people to see another face of some kind. In addition, when an image is distorted, your brain draws from past experiences and expectations to fill in the gaps. Hence the deceased relatives.', 'Interestingly, the same effect â\x80\x9ccan also be obtained during eye-to-eye gazing between two individuals,â\x80\x9d Caputo tells Mental Floss. In fact, this â\x80\x9cinter-subjective gazingâ\x80\x9d produced an even higher number of â\x80\x9cstrange facesâ\x80\x9d seen by test subjects, according to another experiment conducted by Caputo in 2013.', 'So weâ\x80\x99ve ruled out the presence of mirror monsters, but what about Bloody Mary? The origin of this particular mirror game would seem to be related to â\x80\x9cBloodyâ\x80\x9d Mary I, who served as queen of England in the 16th centuryâ\x80\x94but folklorists are unconvinced.', 'That the figure goes by multiple namesâ\x80\x94such as Mary Worth, Mary Worthington, Mary Lou, etc.â\x80\x94suggests against a real person as the inspiration. Psychoanalysts have proposed that the game has to do with young girls and the onset of menstruation. Others have noted earlier analogues of the game, including a Robert Burns poem where he explained that if you â\x80\x9c[t]ake a candle, and go alone to a looking glass; eat an apple before it; and some traditions say, you should comb your hair all the time,â\x80\x9d youâ\x80\x99ll see over your shoulder the face of the person youâ\x80\x99ll marry (and some psychoanalysts have even proposed an importance of the homophone Mary/marry).

It may be hard to tell them apart from far away, but there are several major differences distinguishing the two animals.', 'Animal', 'Group Type', 'Color', 'Range', 'Size', 'Diet', 'Vocalizations', 'Snout', 'Most active', 'Fox', 'Genus', 'Varies by species', 'Every continent except Antarctica', 'Largest species is 8 to 17 pounds', 'Omnivorous', 'Screams', 'Small and pointed', 'At night', 'Coyote', 'Species', 'Mix of tan, black, and gray', 'North America', '22 to 33 pounds', 'Omnivorous', 'Howls', 'Large and long', 'At night', 'Known by the scientific name Canis latrans, coyotes have one of the widest ranges of any North American predator. They can be found anywhere from Alaska to the southern tip of Mexico, and they are one of the few species that has benefited from human development. As urbanization drove Americaâ\x80\x99s wolves to the margins, the coyote population exploded to fill the ecological void. Their main prey is small mammals, but theyâ\x80\x99ve also been known to eat insects, fruit, carrion, and trash, allowing them to survive in cities as well as remote forests and deserts. According to a 2016 study, 96 of the 105 U.S. metro areas that were surveyed were home to coyote populations.', 'Unlike coyotes, not all foxes belong to the same species. All foxes are members of the genus Vulpes, which encompasses several species including red foxes, arctic foxes, and kit foxes. Foxes also arenâ\x80\x99t limited to North America; they can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Many foxes share the coyoteâ\x80\x99s diverse appetite, surviving on bugs, fruit, and food scraps in addition to fresh and dead meat. This also makes them well-adapted to urban environments. Both species tend to do most of their hunting and scavenging at night.Â\xa0', 'With so many overlapping behaviors, the best way to tell coyotes and foxes apart is by sight. Foxes are smaller than coyotes with tiny, pointed snouts. Coyotes have large, long snouts that give them their unique profile. Red foxesâ\x80\x94the largest and most common fox speciesâ\x80\x94measure 3 to 4 feet long and weigh between 8 and 17 pounds. Their fluffy tails are long, making up nearly half their length in some cases. As their name suggests, they are also distinguished by their striking red fur, which is most vibrant during the winter months.', 'Coyotes grow to be about 4 feet long as well, but they have longer legs and stockier bodies. Adults weigh between 22 and 33 pounds. Their coat is a mixture of tan, black, and gray shades that become lighter in the winter.', 'You can also identify foxes and coyotes based on the sounds they make. Coyotes make 11 distinct noises, which include dog-like whines, barks, and yelps in addition to their famous howls. You can hear what they sound like below. ', 'Foxes, meanwhile, have 40 distinct vocalizations. They may have the prettier coat of the two predators, but their calls are much less majestic. If you have ever heard a shrill scream or squawk outside your window in the middle of the night, it was likely a fox.

47,How Do Baby Birds Breathe Inside Their Eggs?,"['big questions', 'science', 'birds', 'animals', 'mf explains it all', 'news', '2024SEOclean']","['You might not realize it while youâ\x80\x99re frying them sunny side up on a Sunday morning, but chicken eggs (and those of other birds and reptiles) offer up some pretty sophisticated pieces of packaging.', 'Hard-shelled bird eggs contain albumen, or â\x80\x9cegg white,â\x80\x9d and a yolk. The fertilized egg cell, or embryo, develops within the yolk and feeds off it, as well as the albumen. The baby bird has shelter, food, almost everything it needs inside the egg; except, it seems, a little fresh air.', 'Animals that develop inside their mothers, like mammals, get their oxygen from mom through the umbilical cord. A bird egg doesnâ\x80\x99t have as obvious a way to take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide, but the egg, again, takes care of things.', 'Directly under the eggâ\x80\x99s shell are two membranes. When the eggs are laid by the mother, theyâ\x80\x99re very warm, and as they cool, the material inside the egg shrinks a little bit. The two membranes pull apart a little and create a small pocket or sack of air. As the baby bird grows, it develops an allantois, which is a hollow pouch that grows out of the bottom part of the chickâ\x80\x99s gut. From there, the pouch fuses to the second membrane (the chorion) thatâ\x80\x99s around the yolk, forming a chorioallantoic membrane. Working similarly to lung tissue, it connects the baby birdâ\x80\x99s circulatory system to the air outside the egg.', 'As the embryo develops, it breathes in oxygen via that membrane and exhales carbon dioxide (CO2). The hollow part of the allantois can also be used to store waste containing nitrogen. ', 'Several thousand microscopic pores all over the surface of the bird egg allow the CO2 to escape and fresh air to get in. These pores also allow moisture to get into the egg to keep developing bird and the egg parts from drying out, which is why hard-boiled eggs always feel a little heavier than raw ones.', 'What becomes of that chorioallantoic membrane after the baby bird hatches? It stays attached to the eggshell. Your chances of seeing it in an unfertilized eggâ\x80\x94like the one youâ\x80\x99re scrambling for breakfastâ\x80\x94are pretty low, since it exists only when a fertilized embryo begins developing. If thereâ\x80\x99s no baby bird inside the egg, you wonâ\x80\x99t be getting it as a morning side dish. ', ""Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

48,The Surprising Origin of Stockholm Syndrome,"['history', 'crime', 'bank', '2024SEOclean']","['Most people associate Stockholm Syndrome, a situation in which people being held captive feel sympathy toward their captors, with publishing heiress Patty Hearst. The 19-year-old college student was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing militant group, in February 1974 and allegedly brainwashed by its leader. She eventually robbed a San Francisco bank and committed other serious crimes with members of the group. ', 'The emotional bonds that Hearst seemed to form with her kidnappers echoed those of a group of hostages involved in another bank robbery eight months earlier. The psychological drama between the Swedish captives and captors was later given the name Stockholm Syndrome.', 'The events went down over a period of six days, from August 23 through August 28, 1973. On the first day, Jan-Erik Olsson strolled into Kreditbanken in central Stockholm, Sweden, and single-handedly held the place up. Two policemen responded to the call. Olsson shot one of them in the hand and made the other sit in a chair, ordering him to sing something. (The policeman chose â\x80\x9cLonesome Cowboy.â\x80\x9d) Olsson then took four bank customers hostage and started making demands: He wanted his friend and expert bank robber Clark Olofsson brought to the bank. He wanted 3 million Swedish kronor. And he wanted a couple of guns, bulletproof vests, helmets, and a fast car.', 'His friend was delivered. While they waited for the other items and planned their escape over the course of the next few days, Olsson and Olofsson kept their captives locked inside of the bank vault. They had a few phone exchanges with Prime Minister Olof Palme, including one where they allowed hostage Kristin Ehnemark to speak. It was during this phone call that it became clear that the hostages were starting to sympathize with their captors. Ehnemark told the prime minister, â\x80\x9cI think you are sitting there playing checkers with our lives. I fully trust Clark and the robber. I am not desperate. They havenâ\x80\x99t done a thing to us. On the contrary, they have been very nice. But you know, Olof, what Iâ\x80\x99m scared of is that the police will attack and cause us to die.â\x80\x9d', 'Other hostages turned sympathetic as well, later saying that they thought Olofsson and Olsson were perfectly lovely. One claustrophobic captive expressed gratitude that the men allowed her to leave the vault as long as she had a rope tied around her neck like a dog, and another hostage who was told he was going to be shot was grateful that Olsson was going to let him get drunk first.', 'On August 28, police finally decided to gas everyone out via a hole they had drilled through the ceiling of the bank vault. The ploy worked, and everyone eventually left the bank unharmed. Both Olofsson and Olsson were captured.', 'Olsson received 10 years in prison. Olofsson was released after appealing his sentence, managing to convince a judge that he had only showed up at the scene of the crime to help ensure the safety of the hostages. He became friendly with his captives over the years, even getting chummy with Ehnemarkâ\x80\x99s whole family when he wasnâ\x80\x99t in prison on various charges over the next few decades.', 'Some reports say that each captor even eventually married one of their hostages. While thatâ\x80\x99s not true, Olsson did marry one of the many women he corresponded with while in prisonâ\x80\x94apparently his hostages werenâ\x80\x99t the only ones in whom he inspired sympathy.', 'Why would Stock Syndrome happen, though? How could anyone feel sympathy for their would-be murderers to the point that they would befriend them? Psychologists believe that the process of developing sympathy is a survival tactic: To make the situation less stressful and more manageable, the captive comes to believe that the captor is their friend, that he or she is a good person deep down, and they can get out of this predicament together.', 'A version of this story was published in 2013; it has been updated for 2024.', 'manual', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52448/story-behind-stockholm-syndrome

While red, yellow, and green foods are abundant in nature, blue ingredients are much harder to come by. Even the most famously â\x80\x9cblueâ\x80\x9d fruit in the produce aisle has a misleading name. As new research shared in the journal Science Advances explains, blueberries contain no blue pigments, which means theyâ\x80\x99re not blue in the true sense of the word.', 'For their study, which was published on February 7, 2024, a team of scientists from Germany and the UK investigated the adaptations blueberries use to achieve their colorful appearance without pigmentation. The pigments of most fruits come through in their juices (anyone who has ever stained their cutting board slicing cherries for a pie knows this). That isnâ\x80\x99t the case with blueberries, which suggested to the researchers that there was a rarer mechanism at play.Â\xa0', 'They searched for the answer in the berryâ\x80\x99s waxy coating. In addition to keeping it clean and protected, this outer layer is responsible for the fruitâ\x80\x99s unique coloring. After studying the wax through an electron microscope, the scientists discovered nanostructures that scatter blue and ultraviolet light while absorbing all other wavelengths on the light spectrum. This produces something called â\x80\x9cstructural color,â\x80\x9d and itâ\x80\x99s also behind the blue and indigo hues you see in plums and juniper berries. The iridescent greenish-blue in peacock feathers is another example of a color in nature that comes from physical structures rather than pigmentation.Â\xa0', 'The team was also able to recreate the structures in a lab. After sampling the wax from the outside of the blueberry, they successfully recrystalized it and isolated the blue-scattering colorant, which is only two microns wide. The findings suggest that the colorant could be used to make new types of blue paints and dyes in the future.Â\xa0', 'manual', 'â\x80\x9cIt was really interesting to find that there was an unknown coloration mechanism right under our noses, on popular fruits that we grow and eat all the time,â\x80\x9d study co-author Rox Middleton, research fellow at the University of Bristolâ\x80\x99s School of Biological Sciences, said in a press release.', 'The color blue is scarce in the plant kingdom.

This bohemian era would later inspire many paintings in his collection The Frieze of Life, which, as Olson et al. pointed out, includes The Scream.', 'For years, the Krakatoa theory enjoyed supremacy as the likeliest origin story for Munchâ\x80\x99s greatest gift to artâ\x80\x94until 2017, when three Norwegian researchers came forward with a scintillating alternative.', 'If temperatures in the stratosphere fall below the ice frost pointâ\x80\x94around â\x80\x93120Â°F or soâ\x80\x94water particles can freeze and form nacreous clouds, or mother-of-pearl clouds. (Nacreous comes from nacre, another term for mother-of-pearl.) They get their name from the iridescence created when those ice crystals diffract light, which can make for a pretty stunning sunset.', 'Because nacreous clouds can only exist in such frigid conditions, theyâ\x80\x99re not often seen outside polar regions. But not often isnâ\x80\x99t neverâ\x80\x94and observations of nacreous clouds in southern Norway were recorded on a number of occasions throughout the 1880s and early 1890s.', 'Norwegian meteorologist Svein M. Fikke and his fellow researchers posited that Munch may have been among the observers in Oslo at some point during that era, and the hypothesis was soon championed by other investigators. Even Robock changed his tune: He co-authored a 2018 paper with atmospheric physicist Fred Prata and environmental writer Richard Hamblyn in which they demonstrate through color analysis that The Screamâ\x80\x99s sky more closely matches a mother-of-pearl sunset than a volcanic one.', 'One salient point on the board for nacreous clouds is that they, like the layers in The Scream, are quite wavy. â\x80\x9cThis is generally not seen in red sunsets and volcanic sunsets, where the cloudless sky tends to be variegated and the sky with clouds tends to have variations but little or no waviness,â\x80\x9d Prata et al. wrote. They also noted that if Munch was illustrating nacreous clouds, The Scream â\x80\x9cin all likelihood would represent the first graphical depiction of a type of cloud largely unknown to meteorology at the time.â\x80\x9d', 'The researchers did acknowledge the impracticality of applying scientific color analysis to Expressionist art. Maybe Munchâ\x80\x99s palette lacked what he needed to duplicate the hues of a volcanic sunset, or maybe he just never intended to duplicate them. After all, The Scream is much more concerned with depicting a mental state than a landscape. Not that an artwork canâ\x80\x99t do bothâ\x80\x94and itâ\x80\x99s hard to see Munchâ\x80\x99s magnum opus next to nacreous clouds without noticing the resemblance.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/the-scream-munch-nacreous-clouds

These materials, as well as many others, all contribute to that new car smell.', ""Although the scent smells heavenly to many, it can be as toxic as it is intoxicating.

After all, people have been trying to solve them for decades, if not centuries, and theyâ\x80\x99ve got nothing but reasonable theories (and plenty of unreasonable ones) to show for it. Eyewitnesses are usually long dead, and key evidence has been lost to the mists of time. Sometimes entire cultures have vanished, leaving no written records to explain their most remarkable achievements. Or maybe there was only ever one person who could lay the mystery to rest, and theyâ\x80\x99ve taken the answer to their grave. From geologic puzzles of deep time to unsolved crimes of the 20th century, here are 15 of historyâ\x80\x99s greatest mysteriesâ\x80\x94most of which remained unsolved to this day.Â\xa0', 'Finding the burial place of Cleopatra VII, who is usually considered the last monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander the Greatâ\x80\x94and therefore the last pharaoh of Egyptâ\x80\x94would undoubtedly be one of the crowning archaeological achievements in modern history. The problem is, no one knows where to look.Â\xa0', 'Conventional wisdom places Cleopatraâ\x80\x99s tomb beside her palace in an area of ancient Alexandria that is now submerged beneath the Mediterranean Sea. If this is the case, the tomb is likely lost forever.Â\xa0', 'But a few researchers have set their sights on Taposiris Magna, the location of a temple dedicated to Osiris, the Egyptian ruler of the realm of the dead, near Alexandriaâ\x80\x99s western outskirts. Since Cleopatra wanted to associate herself and her Roman lover, Mark Antony, with Osiris and his sister-wife, Isis, some believe it stands to reason that the two could be interred there. Excavations at Taposiris Magna were still underway in 2023, and have so far yielded 16 burial chambers, mummies with golden tongues, funeral masks, coins engraved with the legendary queenâ\x80\x99s face, and a tunnel more than 4000 feet longâ\x80\x94but no signs of Cleopatra.', 'If youâ\x80\x99re especially captivated by the legend of Cleopatraâ\x80\x99s tomb, youâ\x80\x99re welcome to help look for it: The Taposiris Magna excavation has been turned into a hands-on tourist experience that starts at about $21,000 per person.Â\xa0', 'If youâ\x80\x99ve heard of the Mary Celeste, you can thank Arthur Conan Doyle. The unexplained abandonment of the ship in 1872â\x80\x94and the still-unknown fate of the 10 people aboardâ\x80\x94might have been forgotten if not for Conan Doyle publishing a sensational short story about the fictional Marie Celeste in 1884 that captured the popular imagination and turned the American merchant ship into one of the most enduring maritime mysteries of all time.', 'In terms of solving the mystery of the Mary Celeste and the fate of its captain, his wife and 2-year-old daughter, and its seven-man crew, Doyleâ\x80\x99s highly fictionalized account, involving a missing African artifact and a murderous mutiny led by a man who had been born into enslavement in America, was unhelpful. But the official inquiry conducted years earlier had also failed to come up with any reason for the crew to have abandoned a seaworthy vessel. There was three and half feet of water in the hold and a pump had been dismantled, and the shipâ\x80\x99s lifeboat was gone. But the ship was safe and operable when it was found drifting near the Azores islands, and the crew who found it had no trouble sailing it 800 miles to Gibraltar to file a salvage claim.Â\xa0', 'In 2006, a chemistry professor at University College London proposed a solution: A â\x80\x9cpressure-wave type of explosionâ\x80\x9d caused by the shipâ\x80\x99s cargoâ\x80\x94around 1700 barrels of industrial alcoholâ\x80\x94and some unknown spark had caused little damage but frightened the crew into abandoning the vessel. But other researchers have discounted the theory. While the mystery around the Mary Celeste remains unsolved, it continues to serve as inspiration for storytellers: Season 4 of True Detective was partially inspired by the abandoned ship as well as the Dyatlov Pass incident, another historical head scratcher.Â\xa0', 'In 1869, American geologist and explorer John Wesley Powell was working in the Grand Canyon when he noticed something strange: What should have been thousands of feet of rock were just hundreds, and as tools and techniques improved, it became clear that in parts of the Grand Canyon over a billion yearsâ\x80\x99 worth of rock was missing. Since the missing time immediately precedes the Cambrian explosionâ\x80\x94the period when evolution seems to have kicked into high gear and life on Earth suddenly and rapidly diversifiedâ\x80\x94scientists would very much like to know more about it.Â\xa0', 'Rock strata are full of gaps, or â\x80\x9cunconformities,â\x80\x9d but a billion years is a big one, even in terms of geologic time.

Whatever happened, it wasnâ\x80\x99t a local phenomenonâ\x80\x94since Powell noticed the anomaly in the Grand Canyon, itâ\x80\x99s been spotted in other parts of the world as well. The gap is twice as large in some places, representing more than 40 percent of the planetâ\x80\x99s history that just isnâ\x80\x99t there.', 'So where did it go? Two main theories have emerged in recent years. The first maintains that the missing rock was scoured away by glaciers a few hundred million years ago, during whatâ\x80\x99s known as the Snowball Earth period. The other theory is a little more dramatic: The culprit might be Rodinia, a supercontinent that predates Pangaea and potentially sliced away huge swathes of what would become our geologic record as pieces of the enormous land mass broke away, slid around the planet, and smashed back together. Itâ\x80\x99s also possible that the Great Unconformity isnâ\x80\x99t one gap, but many smaller ones caused by a series of distinct geologic events.', 'Whatever the cause, the Great Unconformity is a case of one mystery that might hold the key to another. Some researchers believe that when the missing rock was deposited into Earthâ\x80\x99s oceans, it altered the chemistry of the water and seeded it with vast amounts of minerals and nutrients. This could have given early lifeforms the resources they needed to evolve helpful things like shells and skeletons, setting the stage for the Cambrian explosion.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'If you type the phrase Salish Sea into Googleâ\x80\x99s search field, the autocomplete feature assumes youâ\x80\x99re going to ask it about all those feet. The phenomenon seems to have started in 2007, when a 12-year-old girl found a running shoe containing a human foot on a British Columbia beach. Since then, more than 20 disembodied feet, most of them secured in sneakers, have washed ashore on the Salish Seaâ\x80\x99s U.S. and Canadian coastlines. The embarrassment of extremities has prompted sinister theories ranging from the somewhat plausible (a serial killer is clearly at work) to the fantastic (itâ\x80\x99s obviously aliens). Science, however, has requested that we all calm down a little and consider the facts.Â\xa0', 'For starters, authorities have ruled out foul play, determining that several of the feet belonged to people who died accidentally or by suicide. Roughly 8.7 million people live along these shores, and thereâ\x80\x99s a grim correlation between seaside population density and the number of corpses that end up in the water. But if itâ\x80\x99s a natural phenomenon, why is it just feet? Why did it start happening so recently? And why just the shores around the Salish Sea?Â\xa0', 'Science can help us here, too. The bodies of drowning victimsâ\x80\x94a category that would include most of the people who die in the waters of the Salish Seaâ\x80\x94tend to sink, where their soft tissue is consumed by bottom-dwelling animals such as crabs and lobsters. Since soft tissue is much of whatâ\x80\x99s holding our feet on, they can easily become detached. If theyâ\x80\x99re tucked inside running shoes or hiking boots that are made of lightweight, buoyant materialsâ\x80\x94technology that began to develop rapidly around the time the feet started washing ashoreâ\x80\x94theyâ\x80\x99re likely to bob up to the surface, where the Salish Seaâ\x80\x99s distinctive combination of geography, wind conditions, and currents conspire to deposit them on beaches rather than carry them out to the open ocean. For all intents and purposes, we can probably mark this one â\x80\x9csolved.â\x80\x9d', 'Long before the Maya (at least the Classical Period of Maya) and Aztecs built sophisticated civilizations in what is now Central America and Mexico, the area was home to the Olmecs, a society that flourished around 3200 to 2400 years ago. As the first great civilization of Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are sometimes considered a â\x80\x9cmother cultureâ\x80\x9d that influenced many of the peoples who would come in their wake. They cultivated an extensive trade network and possessed impressive engineering skills, but we know them best for the spectacular art they left behind, including approximately 17 colossal stone heads that have been discovered to date.Â\xa0', 'The mystery of the heads is two-fold. First, their sizeâ\x80\x94some are nearly 10 feet tall, and they weigh about 8 tons on averageâ\x80\x94would have presented enormous logistical challenges. Each head is carved from a single volcanic basalt boulder, and each of those boulders had to be moved more than 50 miles from where it was sourced. How did they do it? And second, why did they go to all that trouble?', 'Given the resources and labor required to transport and create them and the fact that they appear to depict distinct individuals, most archaeologists think the heads are portraits of powerful Olmec rulers (though some have suggested they could represent ballgame players who were maybe not that good). As for how they were moved such long distances, several theories have been suggested, ranging from wooden rollers to enormous rafts to temporary causeways built specifically for their transport. Answering these questions would fill in some important blanks in our knowledge of human history, but so far researchers can only make educated guesses.Â\xa0', 'manual', 'Exploration is a dangerous business.

Other than showing a flight attendant a device he claimed was a bomb, his crime was nonviolent, and it was stunning in its boldness.', 'The day before Thanksgiving in 1971, Cooper boarded a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle. A little after 3 p.m., he handed a flight attendant a note, flashed his supposed bomb, and made his demand: He was to be given $200,000 in cash and four parachutes, saying, â\x80\x9cNo funny stuff or Iâ\x80\x99ll do the job.â\x80\x9d The plane landed in Seattle, traded its passengers and most of the flight attendants for Cooperâ\x80\x99s ransom, and took off again.', 'As the plane flew over an area somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Cooper jumped into the cold, rainy night, buffeted by 200-mph winds, with nothing but the business suit (and possibly a trench coat) he was wearing, two parachutes, and $200,000 (a little more than $1.5 million in todayâ\x80\x99s currency). The ensuing manhunt, officially known as NORJAK, for â\x80\x9cNorthwest Hijacking,â\x80\x9d lasted 45 years and yielded 800 suspects but no arrests.

Then, on December 26, a relief lighthouse keeper found the Flannan Isle structure abandoned. A search turned up no trace of the men, but there were signs that a violent storm had torn across the island: Supplies were strewn across the ground well above sea level, iron railings were twisted, and an enormous boulder had been dislodged.Â\xa0', 'The subsequent investigation assumed the men had been caught in the storm and swept out to sea, but troubling details remained. For instance, if the men had ventured into the storm to secure equipment as had been assumed, why did one of them leave his raingear behind? A theory suggested by shepherds who grazed their sheep on the island connected the menâ\x80\x99s deaths to a powerful marine spout that would sporadically shoot dangerous volumes of compressed seawater into the air. Perhaps one man stayed behind while the other two went out into a storm to secure equipment, saw from the lighthouse that conditions were right for the water to erupt, and rushed out to warn the others, only for all three to be swept out to sea in the storm. Others discount the compressed water explanation, but broadly agree that two of the men were outside doing something and for some reason the third man had to run outside in a hurry. A few years later, the poet Wilfrid Wilson Gibson invented stories of an overturned chair and partially eaten food, helping to create an enduring mystery.', 'The story of King Arthur is one of the most influential and widely studied literary cycles in Western culture, but thereâ\x80\x99s one big thing we donâ\x80\x99t know about it: Did Arthur really exist?', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s a vague reference to a legendary hero named Arthur in the Welsh poem Y Gododdin dated to around the 6th or 7th century, but itâ\x80\x99s not that simple. The story survives in a couple different versions written centuries later, and only one of them mentions Arthur. Whether the Arthur reference is a 7th century original, a 13th century addition, or something in between is a contested area of scholarship.', 'The first explicit accounts date back to the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which documented 12 battles supposedly fought against the Saxons by a British military commander identified as Arthur. His feats were impressive, to say the leastâ\x80\x94in the 12th battle, he supposedly killed over 900 enemy soldiers all by himself.', 'Cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth built on Arthurâ\x80\x99s legend in the 12th century with his History of the Kings of Britain, and subsequent Arthurian poems and romances added now-familiar elements such as the Round Table and the quest for the Holy Grail. It wasnâ\x80\x99t until the 15th century that Thomas Malory came along and gave us what many now think of as the definitive story of King Arthur, Le Morte dâ\x80\x99Arthur.Â\xa0', 'When we ask whether Arthur really existed, itâ\x80\x99s important to decide which version of him weâ\x80\x99re asking about. If itâ\x80\x99s the one that began with Geoffreyâ\x80\x94a glorious king who once ruled most of Europeâ\x80\x94the answer is probably no. If such a ruler had existed, odds are slim he would have been omitted from the historical record. But the Historia Brittonumâ\x80\x99s earlier account of a great military leader called Arthur might have some basis in fact. The author probably got some of the details wrongâ\x80\x94it would have been logistically impossible for one man to have fought in all 12 of the battlesâ\x80\x94but itâ\x80\x99s not impossible that at some point in the dim and distant past there was a real military leader who rallied the fractured tribes of early medieval Britain against their Saxon invaders.', 'Englandâ\x80\x99s plan to colonize North America did not get off to a smooth start. By the time artist-turned-explorer John White and about 115 colonists arrived on Roanoke Island off the coast of modern-day North Carolina in 1587, the settlement already had a reputation. It had been abandoned once in 1586, and a garrison of 15 men who were later deposited there, tasked with holding the land on Englandâ\x80\x99s behalf, also disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a single skeleton to greet the next batch of colonists, who werenâ\x80\x99t even supposed to be staying there. (The plan had been to proceed up to the Chesapeake Bay after stopping at Roanoke Island, but the conventional story is that the captain refused to go further.) Thereâ\x80\x99s no reason to have expected Whiteâ\x80\x99s colonyâ\x80\x94which settled in an area where their recent predecessors had had trouble securing food, encountered formidable weather, and were quickly burning through any good will the Native American populations had shown themâ\x80\x94would have fared any better.', 'The colonists arrived too late in the year to grow their own food, and White returned to England for more supplies. The first Anglo-Spanish War delayed his return, and when he finally got back in 1590, everyone was gone. But White didnâ\x80\x99t seem puzzled by their disappearance. Someone had carved the word CROATOAN, the name of both a nearby island and the friendly Native American group who inhabited it, into a palisade post (or maybe a tree). White had instructed that if the colonists found themselves in distress, they should carve a type of cross alongside the location, but there was no crossâ\x80\x94so he interpreted as a â\x80\x9ccertaine token of their safe being at Croatoan.â\x80\x9d But a storm stopped him from sailing there to look for them, and he was never able to raise the money to finance another expedition to the New World.Â\xa0', 'Hard archeological evidence for Whiteâ\x80\x99s proclamation â\x80\x9cof their safe being at Croatoanâ\x80\x9d is still lacking. Most researchers think the settlers were either killed by Native Americans whoâ\x80\x99d turned hostile to European colonizers or, more likely, were absorbed into friendlier Native populations. Â\xa0', 'According to archeologist Charles Ewen, the idea that thereâ\x80\x99s anything particularly strange about the colonyâ\x80\x99s disappearance might be a relatively modern development. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s no big mystery until you start to get a historical type of writing in the 1800s,â\x80\x9d he told The New York Times in 2020, pointing out that failed colonization attempts were hardly out of the ordinary (though Ewen himself is skeptical of the Croatoan explanation for a lack of actual evidence). Science writer Andrew Lawler, author of The Secret Token: Myth, Obsession, and the Search for the Lost Colony of Roanoke, told Salon that â\x80\x9cthe â\x80\x98Lost Colonyâ\x80\x99 is a product of the 19th centuryâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94a time, he says, when â\x80\x9cthe idea of the colonists assimilating with the Native Americans was a taboo.â\x80\x9d', 'Between 1485 and 1551, England suffered five outbreaks of a disease so virulent that it could kill an otherwise healthy person in a matter of hours. Its favorite targets seemed to be wealthy adult males; children and elderly people were generally spared, while the aristocracy, members of professional classes, and the clergy seemed particularly vulnerable. The epidemics were short-lived but brutal, and in all but at most a handful of instances the disease did not spread beyond England.', 'Symptoms came on quickly; according to one account it came with â\x80\x9ca sudden great sweating and stinking with redness of the face and of all the bodyâ\x80\x9d along with fever, headaches, and delirium. As many as half of those afflicted died within 18 hours. Anyone who made it through the first day would probably recover, but there was always a chance of reinfection.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Whatever the disease was, it vanished as mysteriously as it appeared. The last outbreak was in 1551, and apart from some potential minor appearances in the following decades, we havenâ\x80\x99t seen it sinceâ\x80\x94though a similar affliction, known as the â\x80\x9cPicardy sweat,â\x80\x9d popped up in France a century and a half later, causing nearly 200 small outbreaks before it too disappeared in 1861.', 'Many theories have been floated over the centuries. Itâ\x80\x99s been suggested that the English sweating sickness could have been a strain of typhus or influenza, or even anthrax. A more likely answer emerged in 1993, when a similar outbreak occurred in the American Southwest. This disease was caused by a hantavirus, leading researchers to speculate that a hantavirus was also behind the English sweating sickness and the Picardy sweat. Since hantaviruses can be spread by rodents, this could explain why large households and academic institutions were hit so hard by the disease: Well-stocked kitchens and pantries would have attracted mice and rats, and household staff could have aerosolized the virus in their droppings while sweeping. This might be the best solution we get; according to a 2014 paper published in the journal Viruses, a conclusive answer will probably never come.Â\xa0', 'The Nazca (or Nasca) Lines are an array of geoglyphs carved into the coastal plain of southern Peru.

According to UNESCO, the Nazca Lines are â\x80\x9cunmatched in [their] extent, magnitude, quantity, size, diversity and ancient tradition to any similar work in the world.â\x80\x9d They were built over the course of 1000 years, mostly by removing darker stones to reveal the lighter colored sand underneath.Â\xa0', 'The question that still puzzles researchers is, why were the geoglyphs made? For decades, some archaeologists believed they served as giant astronomical calendars, possibly linked to constellations or other celestial bodies. Recent research suggests a more earthly purpose: It now appears that the Nazca Lines might have been connected to rituals meant to appeal to the gods for rain. Itâ\x80\x99s possible they marked processional routes used by pilgrims as they traveled to temples, or that rituals were performed at designated points along the lines themselves.Â\xa0', 'We donâ\x80\x99t know when, where, or by whom the Voynich Manuscript was written, but thereâ\x80\x99s an even larger mystery to solve: We have absolutely no idea what it even says.

Some, including the late U.S. Army cryptographer William Friedman, believe Voynich was written in a synthetic language. Others think the manuscript uses a dead language such as proto-Romance, a precursor of vulgar Latin (though that claim was highly controversial), or that it could be written in some form of code or cipher.Â\xa0', 'Whatever the case, the book is divided into six sections: one devoted to botanical studies; one that is apparently concerned with astrological and astronomical matters; one that contains elaborate (and super weird) biological drawings; a section containing what Yale University, the bookâ\x80\x99s keeper since 1969, identifies as â\x80\x9ccosmological medallionsâ\x80\x9d; a section dedicated to pharmaceutical sketches; and a text-only portion devoted to what appear to be recipes.Â\xa0', 'Since bookseller Wilfrid Voynich found the manuscript in 1912, secreted in a bundle of medieval manuscripts heâ\x80\x99d purchased from a Jesuit college, the book and its complicated history have been obsessively studied and analyzed.

But the act of biting into a chip and then dunking it back into the dip, or â\x80\x9cdouble-dipping,â\x80\x9d seems like an invitation to spread disease. We donâ\x80\x99t walk up and take random bites of food from a personâ\x80\x99s hand, so why do we tolerate this?', 'In an investigative piece for Bon AppÃ©tit, writer Ali Francis posed the question to a number of scientists. One of them was Paul Dawson, PhD, who in 2009 authored what may be the definitive study on whether double-dipping is a sanitary practice. The conclusion: Itâ\x80\x99s disgusting.', 'Dawson conducted a number of experiments to assess bacterial transfer from a personâ\x80\x99s mouth to a communal troughâ\x80\x94in this case, a glass of water.

But a bitten cracker contaminated the water with 1000 more bacteria per milliliter.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Because we donâ\x80\x99t snack on chips and water, Dawson also examined bacterial transfer between bitten and unbitten crackers into a variety of dips, including salsa (Tostitos Extra Chunky, if youâ\x80\x99re wondering) and cheese. The dips had no detectable bacteria prior to dipping. After a double-dip, the bacteria increased in number up to five-fold, demonstrating that germs from our mouths use crackers as a highway to the dips.', 'Whether those germs are going to prove harmful is harder to assess. All mouths contain some bacteria, which may not be an issue. Other times, our mouths will harbor communicable disease, like the common cold, flu, and COVID-19. If someone with problematic bacteria double-dips, itâ\x80\x99s certainly possible for other dippers to ingest a scoop of staph with their Tostitos.', 'Dawson also observed that the kind of dip used matters. Salsa, which is more acidic, is less hospitable to germs. On the other hand, itâ\x80\x99s thin enough so that the dip is more likely to run down a cracker and infect the dipping bowl. Thicker dips may not allow bacteria to move around as easily. Someone might double-dip on one corner, leaving the opposite corner of the bowl a somewhat safer option.', 'So how concerned should you really be? If someone with obvious symptoms of illness is double-dipping, it would be wise to avoid whatever bowl theyâ\x80\x99re hovering over. Really, they shouldnâ\x80\x99t be at a party in the first place. (Though of course asymptomatic people can spread trouble, too.) Otherwise, you can just accept some bacterial transfer is likely and go on with your life. Dips have germs, but so do doorknobs, bathrooms, spice cabinets, and the couch where that one guy keeps sneezing.', 'Still worried? You can try getting to the dip early, use a spoon to grab some on a plate, and have your own dipping station. Hosts can also consider offering smaller chips or crackers that encourage single-dipping.

According to meteorologist Mary Scarzello Fairbanks, who spoke with Prevention in 2021, snow isnâ\x80\x99t all that pristine. Itâ\x80\x99s formed when water droplets freeze around some dust or debris in the air, forming an ice crystal that continues to collect water vapor and form a snowflake.

A dog with piercing blue eyes might be described as strikingly beautiful or borderline unsettling. Rarely do we call the eye color cute, and apparently past generations of dog breeders agreed. As Smithsonian reports, new research suggests we may have selectively bred dogs to have darker eyes to make them appear younger and friendlier.', 'For their study published in the December 2023 issue of Royal Society Open Science, a team of researchers based in Japan compared eye color in gray wolves to that of domestic canines. After analyzing photos of 22 wolves and 81 dogs across 35 breeds, they found that the dogsâ\x80\x99 irises were notably darker on average. While dark brown is the standard eye color in dogs, wolf eyes are more likely to be yellow.Â\xa0', 'Itâ\x80\x99s possible this difference was intentionally selected for by humans. After analyzing canine eye color, the researchers asked participants to look at pictures of dogs and make assumptions about their personalities. Some images were altered to make the petsâ\x80\x99 irises lighter or darker. Dogs with dark eyes scored higher for friendly and nonthreatening traits like kindness, sociability, and trustworthiness, while pale-eyed dogs were more likely to be labeled aggressive and mature. This indicates that humans find brown eyes cute and puppy-like, which could explain why breeders gave preference to the feature.Â\xa0', 'Itâ\x80\x99s not the eye color that people find adorable, but the perceived size of the pupils. Humans are born with relatively large pupils that get smaller as the eye muscles that control them get weaker with age. We associate big pupils with youth, and the darker the iris is, the harder it is to see where the pupil begins. The study authors suspect that brown eyes make pupils appear bigger than they really are, tricking us into thinking our pets are helpless babies that need our protectionâ\x80\x94even when theyâ\x80\x99re 85-pound Labradors.', 'Color isnâ\x80\x99t the only trait that makes a dogâ\x80\x99s eyes appear bigger and more lovable.

65,Citizen Astronaut Kellie Gerardi Envisions the Future of Spaceflight,"['space', 'women', 'business']","['The era of commercial spaceflight is upon us. For the right amount of money, companies like SpaceX will take anyone to see the Earth from above, and in 2019 new NASA regulations allowed the International Space Station to participate in product sponsorships from brands like EstÃ©e Lauder, Mattel, and Adidas. But for Kellie Gerardi, the private-sector space industry offers more than just a joyride or a marketing opportunity. It represents a â\x80\x9cnew space ageâ\x80\x9d of microgravity research and accessibility.', 'Gerardi was one of two bioastronautics researchers on Virgin Galacticâ\x80\x99s recent Galactic 05 mission, a one-hour suborbital spaceflight focused on microgravity research. It was Virgin Galacticâ\x80\x99s sixth spaceflight in six months and its last of 2023. The flight, which reached an altitude of 54 miles above Earth, was an â\x80\x9cadrenaline-pumpingâ\x80\x9d experience with a liftoff right out of a science fiction novel, Gerardi tells Mental Floss, and the culmination of her decade-long career in various roles in the commercial space sector, including working on space policy, hardware, business development, and research. But sheâ\x80\x99s just getting started.', 'Bioastronautics is the study of human life support in space, harnessing biology, psychology, engineering, and other fields to design survival systems for spaceflight. During Gerardiâ\x80\x99s mission, sponsored by her team at the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS), she conducted experiments on the behavior of liquids in low gravity that could help scientists improve medication administration for astronauts, among other things. She also wore multiple biosensors to reveal the impact of microgravity on the body, monitoring factors like her heart rate, skin temperature, and blood glucose levels. The findings should help pave the way for increasingly extended, comfortable space excursions like human-crewed Mars missions.', 'Private-sector research flights like the Galactic 05 mission give research institutions an alternative path to space and, hopefully, more accessible opportunities to study conditions like microgravity, Gerardi says. They â\x80\x9crepresent the beginning of a new era of access to space for the research community,â\x80\x9d she saysâ\x80\x94a â\x80\x9cgoldilocks solutionâ\x80\x9d to current research barriers like the expense of the International Space Station.', 'Her take may be different from the common view of commercial spaceflight as simply space tourism, a pastime for only the wealthiest people that symbolizes economic inequality.', 'Gerardi, though, views figures like billionaire Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos as â\x80\x9cpatronsâ\x80\x9d of the budding industry, part of the broader commercial space environment. Without their investments, research like hers would remain limited, she says, and the market they create ultimately benefits larger efforts to explore and understand our universe. ', 'Thatâ\x80\x99s not to say that she doesnâ\x80\x99t appreciate the role of the government in space exploration. She highlights the historic achievements of NASA as an example of the ongoing value of public institutions. â\x80\x9cFor humanityâ\x80\x99s sake, we need government leading us in exploration where the horizon is unclear,â\x80\x9d she says. â\x80\x9cTo explore, you know, what exists in an ocean on Europa. Those are the types of things that donâ\x80\x99t necessarily have a business case behind them. We benefit as a species from having government institutions lead the way towards extraordinary leaps and bounds for humanity.â\x80\x9d', 'Initially, the commercial space industryâ\x80\x99s efforts toward accessibility â\x80\x9ctook grip in [her] soulâ\x80\x9d and convinced Gerardi to pursue her dreams of space research in a business still dominated by men. As of 2021, only one in five workers in space-related industries were women. The proportion of women going to space itself is even smaller: Fewer than 100 women have flown in space, making up only 11 percent of the worldâ\x80\x99s astronauts and 6.6 percent of those who have been active outside of a spacecraft.', 'For Gerardi, this meant a long struggle to overcome unconscious mental limits. â\x80\x9cI had all this exposure to the world [of STEM],â\x80\x9d she says, â\x80\x9cbut my own schema of understandingâ\x80\x94like, â\x80\x98What is an astronaut?â\x80\x99 â\x80\x98What do they look like?â\x80\x99 â\x80\x98What do they sound like?â\x80\x99 â\x80\x98What do I picture when I close my eyes and think, â\x80\x98astronautâ\x80\x99?â\x80\x94was a very different picture than what I saw when I looked in the mirror.â\x80\x9d', 'This inner journey is part of what prompted Gerardi to write her Luna Muna series of childrenâ\x80\x99s books, featuring a young, overtly â\x80\x9cgirlyâ\x80\x9d female astronaut. She aims to bridge the representation gap for younger generations, and especially her own daughter, Delta. â\x80\x9cThe difference that I see is that my daughter doesnâ\x80\x99t have to adjust anything in her own imagination,â\x80\x9d she says. â\x80\x9cWhen I ask Delta to draw an astronaut, she draws a woman.â\x80\x9d Gerardi looks forward to seeing what future generations of women will achieve when they have the â\x80\x9cconfidence to start out their journeys knowing that all of these paths are available to them.â\x80\x9d', 'Increasing access to spaceâ\x80\x94both for researchers and for underrepresented groupsâ\x80\x94is not only a worthy goal but a necessary one to Gerardi. Creating a utopian, Star Trek future will take people of all different backgrounds and skills coming together, she says. â\x80\x9cSpace is so innately aspirational and inspirational,â\x80\x9d she adds. â\x80\x9cThis is humanityâ\x80\x99s next giant leap. Everybodyâ\x80\x99s talents play a role in getting us to that next chapter.â\x80\x9d', 'Gerardi and her research institute plan to fly again with Virgin Galactic, continuing her research into microgravity and novel medical technologies.

On the cheese spectrum, thatâ\x80\x99s likely cheddar, the firm block that fuels everything from soup to cracker spreads.', 'What gives cheddar its unique appeal? And why does it taste a little differently depending on the source? Science may have an answer.', 'In research published in the journal Nature Communications, and reported by Smithsonian Magazine, microbial ecologists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands examined the unique bacterial identities of cheddar. (All cheese is made by introducing bacteria to milk, which feeds off the sugar and creates lactic acid.) The researchers looked at existing cheddar starter cultures and also made their own using a variety of microorganisms to see which gave cheddar its unique flavor.', 'After a year of ripening, there was a clear winner: Streptococcus thermophilus, which led to the highest levels of lactic acid. Lactococcus cremoris was also singled out for reducing chemicals diacetyl and acetoin, which create an off-taste when thereâ\x80\x99s too much of either present.

But why do we make these promises to ourselves, and where did this tradition come from? And why does this tradition live on when so many people fail to keep the resolutions they make? We can start by blaming the ancient Babylonians.', 'We can trace the earliest recorded celebration honoring the coming of a new year to 4000 years ago in Babylon. Calendars werenâ\x80\x99t as they are today, so the Babylonians kicked things off in late March during the first new moon after the Spring Equinox. The collective ceremonial events were known as the Akitu festival, which lasted 11 days. The festivities were dedicated to the rebirth of the sun god Marduk, but the Babylonians made promises in order to get on the right side of all of their gods. They felt this would help them start the new year on the right foot.', 'Resolutions continued on with the Romans. When the early Roman calendar no longer synced up with the sun, Julius Caesar decided to make a change. He consulted with the best astronomers and mathematicians of the time and introduced the Julian calendar, which more closely represents the modern calendar we use today. Caesar declared January 1 the first day of the year to honor the god of new beginnings, Janus.

Whether youâ\x80\x99re a fan of winter or just wish it would go away, here are 25 things to noteâ\x80\x94or even celebrateâ\x80\x94about the shortest day of the year.', 'The date of the winter solstice varies from year to year, and can fall anywhere between December 20 and December 23, with the 21st or 22nd being the most common dates. The reason for this is because the tropical yearâ\x80\x94the time it takes for the sun to return to the same spot relative to Earthâ\x80\x94is different from the calendar year. The next solstice occurring on December 20 will not happen until 2080, and the next December 23 solstice will not occur until 2303.', 'Not only does the solstice occur on a specific day, but it also occurs at a specific time of day, corresponding to the instant the North Pole is aimed farthest away from the sun on the 23.5Â° tilt of the Earthâ\x80\x99s axis. This is also the time when the sun shines directly over the Tropic of Capricorn. In 2023, this moment occurs at 3:27 a.m. UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on December 22. For those on Eastern Standard Time, the solstice will occur at 10:27 p.m. on December 21. And regardless of where you live, the solstice happens at the same moment for everyone on the planet.', 'As most are keenly aware, daylight hours grow shorter and shorter as the winter solstice approaches and begin to slowly lengthen afterward. Itâ\x80\x99s no wonder that the day of the solstice is referred to in some cultures as the â\x80\x9cshortest day of the yearâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cextreme of winter.â\x80\x9d Washington, D.C. will experience 9 hours and 26 minutes of sunlight. Helsinki, Finland, will get 5 hours and 49 minutes of light. Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, will not have a sunrise at all (and hasnâ\x80\x99t since mid-November; its next sunrise will be on January 23), while the North Pole has had no sunrise since October. The South Pole, though, will be basking in the glow of the midnight sun, which wonâ\x80\x99t set until March.', 'The seeming death of the light and very real threat of starvation over the winter months would have weighed heavily on early societies, who held varied solstice celebrations and rites meant to herald the return of the sun and hope for new life. Cattle and other animals were slaughtered around midwinter, followed by feasting on what was the last fresh meat for several months. The modern Druidic celebration Alban Arthan reveres the death of the Old Sun and birth of the New Sun.', 'The Pilgrims arrived at modern-day Plymouth, Massachusetts, on December 21, 1620, to establish a society in which they could worship freely. On the same day in 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium, ushering in an atomic age. And on December 21, 1968, the Apollo 8 spacecraft launched, becoming the first crewed moon mission.', 'Solstice derives from the Latin term solstitium, containing sol, which means â\x80\x9csun,â\x80\x9d and the past participle stem of sistere, meaning â\x80\x9cto make stand.â\x80\x9d This comes from the fact that the sunâ\x80\x99s position in the sky relative to the horizon at noon, which increases and decreases throughout the year, appears to pause in the days surrounding the solstice. In modern times, we view the phenomenon of the solstice from the position of space, and of the Earth relative to the sun. Earlier peoples, however, were thinking about the sunâ\x80\x99s trajectory, how long it stayed in the sky and what sort of light it cast.', 'The primary axis of Stonehenge is oriented to the setting sun. Some have theorized that the position of the sun was of religious significance to the people who built Stonehenge, while other theories hold that the monument is constructed along natural features that happen to align with it. The purpose of Stonehenge is still subject to debate, but its importance on the winter solstice continues into the modern era, as thousands of hippies, pagans, and other types of solstice enthusiasts gather there every year to celebrate the occasion.', 'The holiday, which began as a festival to honor the agricultural god Saturn, was held to commemorate the dedication of his temple in 497 BCE. It quickly became a time of widespread revelry and debauchery in which societal roles were overturned, with masters serving the people they enslaved and servants being allowed to insult their masters. Mask-wearing and play-acting were also part of Saturnaliaâ\x80\x99s reversals, with each household electing a King of Misrule. Saturnalia was gradually replaced by Christmas throughout the Roman Empire, but many of its customs survive as Christmas traditions.', 'Zoroastrian lore holds that evil spirits wander the Earth and the forces of the destructive spirit Ahriman are strongest on this long night. People are encouraged to stay up most of the night in the company of one another, eating, talking, and sharing poetry and stories, to avoid any brushes with dark entities. Beliefs about the presence of evil on the longest night are also echoed in Celtic and Germanic folklore.', 'December 21, 2012, corresponded to the date 13.0.0.0.0 in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar used by theÂ\xa0Maya, marking the end of a 5126-year cycle. Some people feared this juncture would bring about the end of the world or some other cataclysmic event. Others took a more New Age-y view (literally) and believed it heralded the birth of a new era of deep transformation for Earth and its inhabitants. In the end, neither of these things appeared to occur, leaving the world to turn through winter solstices indefinitely, or at least as long as the sun lasts.', 'Though it doesnâ\x80\x99t feel like it in the Northern Hemisphere, Earth is closer to the sun in early Januaryâ\x80\x94 approximately 3 million miles closerâ\x80\x94than it is in early July. The shortest distance between the sun and a planet is called perihelion; in 2024, Earth will be at perihelion on January 2 and 3.', 'Despite the proximity to the sun, the reason for cold temperatures is because the Northern Hemisphere receives less sunlight and has cooler temperatures in winter due to Earthâ\x80\x99s 23.5Â° tilt. The Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun in winter, and toward it in July.', 'January and February are the coldest days in the Northern Hemisphere despite receiving more sunlight than in Decemberâ\x80\x99s short days. What gives?', 'The delayed reaction is due to the way Earth takes in and releases heat. The planet absorbs heat during the summer months and releases it gradually throughout the fall and into the winter; it doesnâ\x80\x99t fully cool down until January or February. By then, snow is falling in many areas, creating a reflective shield against solar radiation. So, in midwinter, our stores of heat have run outâ\x80\x94and the warmth of the sun is not being absorbed as readily.', 'Dong Zhi means â\x80\x9cwinter arrivesâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cthe arrival of winterâ\x80\x9d and is an important festival during which families gather and celebrate the past year. The festival is believed to have originated as a way to mark the end of the harvest season.', 'Dong Zhi also correlates to the concept of yin and yang because of the seasonâ\x80\x99s balance of day and night. The most popular food during Dong Zhi are glutinous rice balls called tang yuan. Dumplings, wontons, and mutton are also part of the festivities.', 'Though the winter solstice is the day with the least amount of sunlight, thatâ\x80\x99s not because of the sunset. In fact, the earliest sunset happens about two weeks priorâ\x80\x94in 2023 in the U.S., for example, the winter solstice is December 21, but the earliest sunsets occurred on December 8.', 'The discrepancy is due to the way we calculate time. Our clocks operate on an exact 24-hour schedule, but our days are technically a little longer or shorter. One day equals the time between when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, called solar noon, and the next.', 'A solar day is slightly longer than 24 hours during the summer and winter solstices and slightly shorter during the spring and fall equinoxes because of Earthâ\x80\x99s tilt and orbit. During the winter solstice in the U.S. on December 21, solar noon is actually 11:59 a.m. EST.', 'The winter solstice is marked on the astronomical calendar, which is based on Earthâ\x80\x99s position in relation to the sun. The dates of the seasons vary in length and in their start dates.', 'Meteorologists need more consistent start and end dates to chart seasonal data, so they instead use meteorological seasons, which correspond to the calendar. Each season lasts three months. Meteorological winter, therefore, starts on December 1 and includes December, January, and February.', 'Because the solstice has to do with a planetâ\x80\x99s tilt and orbit around the sun, every other planet in our solar system also experiences a winter solstice of sortsâ\x80\x94though the seasons themselves look much different that ours.', 'The seasons on Neptune and Uranus last decades, while Venus has the shortest seasons. Mars orbits the sun in a much more elliptical way than Earth, so its years are 687 days long and its fluctuations more extreme.', 'Newgrange, a tomb mound built in Ireland about 1000 years before Stonehenge, lights up dramatically during the winter solstice. A roof-box above the entrance coordinates with the light from the winter solstice sunrise so that a beam of light travels the 19-meter passage and then illuminates the chamber for about 17 minutes.

Some pagans consider Yule the beginning of the new year, a time when the days start getting longer. Druids would burn Yule logs for 12 days to eliminate evil spirits and bring about good luck.', 'Druid priests believed mistletoe, a parasitic evergreen plant that grows among oak branches, was the soul of the tree. The high priest would climb an oak on the sixth night of the new moon after the winter solstice and cut down pieces of the mistletoe, which people would wear for good luck and protection from evil spirits.', 'European and Asian peoplesâ\x80\x99 winter solstice ceremonies sometimes included liberal use of fly agaric mushrooms, notable for their bright red caps with white dots. The mushroom is poisonous and causes hallucinations, and can be found under oaks, firs, and spruce trees.', 'Rituals included drying and stringing the mushrooms near the hearth. One theory posits that the legend of Santa Claus sprang from a story of ancient shamans who would collect the mushrooms, dry them, and hand them out as gifts on the winter solstice, all while dressed in mushroom-mimicking red suits with white spots. One side effect of eating the mushrooms is a rosy, flushed face, adding to the wintery imageryâ\x80\x94not to mention the trippy idea of flying reindeer (which have also been known to snack on the mushrooms).', 'In northern Arizona, the Hopi people celebrate Soyal, or Soyaluna, the winter solstice celebration.

And with that comes a pretty important question: Why is snow, which is so quiet when itâ\x80\x99s falling out of the sky, so loud on the ground, squeaking, creaking, and crunching under our boots?', 'The reason, as it turns out, is science. Snow is made up of ice crystals. While ice is a solid, it actually has a thin (as in, a few nanometers) quasi-liquid layer (QLL) on its surface. Michael Faraday, better known for his work on magnetism and electrochemistry, first suggested this idea in the 1850s. While scientists have confirmed it since then, the origins and many of the characteristics of the QLL are unclear.', 'One thing we do know, though, is that the thickness of the QLL depends on temperature. When snow is warmer, the QLL around all those ice crystals is softer. When you step on the snow, you compress the crystals, but the liquid allows them to quietly slide past each other. When snow is colder and the QLL is stronger, thereâ\x80\x99s more friction between the crystals, and they donâ\x80\x99t slide so easily. When you step on colder snow, the crystals rub against each other and also break, making that oh so familiar squeaking sound.', 'The dividing line between squeaky and non-squeaky snow is around 14Â°F, so if that crunchy noise tends to bother you, then that would be good to keep in mind before you lace up your boots and go on a walk in the snow.

On his Compound Chemistry blog, chemist Andy Brunning noted that studies in 2008 and 2011 concluded that prunes do indeed make effective laxatives.', 'Like many fruits, prunes are high in insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to food in the process of digestion while also helping it pass through the system faster.

The explosion scattered 400 times more radioactive material than the dropping of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, and over 200,000 people had to be evacuated from the area.

And though the alcohol is diluted with water also from Chernobyl, that water comes from a deep underground aquifer 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) south of the power plant.

Instead of radiating outward from Paris, the movement developed simultaneously and at times autonomously in different parts of Europe.', 'In England, there was economist Adam Smith, author of the pro-capitalist text The Wealth of Nations (1776). In North America, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson channeled enlightened ideals into the fight for American independence and democratic rule in the 1770s and â\x80\x9880s. And from his lifelong home in KÃ¶nigsberg (now Kaliningrad), German philosopher Immanuel Kant formulated his categorical imperative: ethical rules that applied to every member of society, be they lord or lowborn.', 'The principles that united Enlightenment thinkers from different countriesâ\x80\x94rationalism, empiricism, skepticism, and subjectivismâ\x80\x94are the same principles that guide contemporary researchers and academics today. Rationalism holds that knowledge should be gained through reason rather than emotion or faith; empiricism and skepticism are reminders to question everything and everyone; and subjectivism is an acknowledgement that truth is often dependent on oneâ\x80\x99s own viewpoint.', 'The nature of modern-day scientific research can be traced back to proto-Enlightenment philosophers like Descartes, who died in 1650. Just as Descartesâ\x80\x94who coined the iconic phrase cogito, ergo sum (â\x80\x9cI think, therefore I amâ\x80\x9d)â\x80\x94accepted propositions as true only if he was unable to prove them false. Today, research projects from middle schools to universities revolve around the investigation of a â\x80\x9cnull hypothesis,â\x80\x9d which attempts to disprove a hypothesis that claims thereâ\x80\x99s no difference between two variables.', 'The Enlightenment has several different causes. Sustained funding from the â\x80\x9cSun King,â\x80\x9d Louis XIV, who invested in art and culture to impress other European nations, brought creatives and intellectuals to Paris. The Protestant Reformation, a revolt against the Roman Catholic Church and its doctrines, objected to the age-old notion that monarchs derived their earthly authority from God.', 'The scientific revolution of the 16th and early 17th centuries, itself a product of the Reformation, also contributed to the Enlightenment through discoveries that refuted commonly held beliefs, like Earth being the center of the solar system. Last but not least, the Enlightenment owes its existence to the Renaissance, which, in addition to renewing long-dead art styles, revived interest in classical texts from Platoâ\x80\x99s dialogues to the republican philosophy of ancient Rome.', 'Technically, civil unrest in France started over monetary issues: debt accumulated by international conflicts like the American Revolution and King Louis XVIâ\x80\x99s plan to increase taxes in response. The shape this unrest took, however, was undoubtedly the result of ideas introduced during the Enlightenment. Protestors were not merely rebelling against their king, but against the political system he represented.', 'Echoes of â\x80\x9clibertÃ©, Ã©galitÃ©, fraternitÃ©â\x80\x9d can be read in many Enlightenment texts, including The Social Contract (1762) by Rousseau. Arguing that flawed institutions corrupted the inherent goodness of humanity, and not the other way around (as his conservative opponents believed), Rousseau proposed that kings received their power from the people, and that, if they did not honor this relationship, the people were within their rights to take that power away.', 'As in every artistic, philosophical, or political movement, there were proponents of the Enlightenment who wished to carry its principles to their extreme. In France, such proponents included the Committee of Public Safety, created in 1793 to defend the Revolution from domestic and foreign foes. Backed by the blade of the guillotine, it implemented policies that ranged from radical to nonsensical.', 'Among other things, the committee sought to replace Christianity with what its leader, the vindictive lawyer-turned-tyrant Maximilien de Robespierre, referred to as the â\x80\x9cCult of the Supreme Being,â\x80\x9d an organization dedicated to the worship of the idea of god, rather than a specific deity. Revolutionaries even changed the French calendar, introducing weeks that lasted for 10 days instead of seven and a year that began on a date corresponding to September 22, all to avoid marking time with Christian associations.

Acting as an â\x80\x9cenlightened despot,â\x80\x9d the Corsican general used his absolute power to pass sweeping reforms that, under more democratic circumstances, might never have seen the light of day.', 'During his 15 years on the throne, Napoleon gave France a judicial branch, a central bank, and a secondary schooling system (the lycÃ©es). He replaced the nepotism of the ancien rÃ©gime with a meritocratic and organized bureaucracy, abolished medieval feudalism, implemented religious freedom, and introduced equality before the law via his Napoleonic Code, aspects of which remain embedded in European constitutions to this day.', 'Yet, as a part of his quest to expand the global French Empire, Napoleon also restored slavery in the French Caribbean in 1802 and denied equal rights to free people of color.', 'A common misconception about the Enlightenment is that the movement helped put an end to human bondage in the European colonies. Although the Enlightenment took place shortly before several European nations abolished slavery, starting with Denmark in 1803, the connection between the two historical events remains ambiguous.', 'The truth is that, while some enlightened thinkers opposed slavery, others went out of their way promoting it. Thinkers like Rousseau and Locke argued the unalienable rights of man transcended skin color, rendering slavery unnatural and inexcusable, but many of their contemporaries advocated for white supremacy. These included several U.S. founding fathers, as well as Kant, who subscribed to the false idea of a hierarchy of races.', 'Given that France allied itself with the 13 American colonies in the Revolutionary War, it should come as no surprise that the Enlightenment had a profound impact on the design of the U.S. government. This influence is present in the 1776 Declaration of Independence, which identifies life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as basic human rights.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'These rights, along with the separation of powers as outlined by Montesquieuâ\x80\x99s 1748 text The Spirit of the Laws, were further enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Any student of American history will also recognize that the fledgling country adopted the Enlightenmentâ\x80\x99s contradictory attitudes towards racial equality, with many landowning elite praising Rousseauâ\x80\x99s Social Contract while failing to apply its teachings to anyone who wasnâ\x80\x99t white.Â\xa0', 'Before the 1700s, fiction generally existed in the form of poetry and theatre. Although the first European novel, Miguel de Cervantesâ\x80\x99s 1605 classic Don Quixote, predates the Enlightenment by more than a century, enlightened thinkers helped mold this underdeveloped medium into the engrossing literary form we know and love today.', 'Several of the characteristics that define the modern novelâ\x80\x94an interest in individual experience, varying degrees of realism and social critique, and emphasis on dialogueâ\x80\x94stem from the Enlightenment. A prime example of a prototypical enlightened novel is Candide by Voltaire. Published in 1759, the story about a young, naÃ¯ve, and passionate man trying to figure out the best way to live life went on to inspire generations of novelists across the world.', 'Another popular misconception about the Enlightenment is that the movement accepted logic and reason at the expense of passion and emotion. According to this narrative, the cold and calculated rationality of the Enlightenment eventually gave way to Romanticism, a movement that valued everything the Enlightenment took for granted, including ambition, sentiment, and the sublime beauty of nature.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s an appealing and easily digestible interpretation of the past, but not entirely correct. As Henry Martyn Lloyd, an honorary research fellow in philosophy at the University of Queensland, points out in an article for Aeon magazine, the Enlightenment was more diverse and complex than people give it credit for, with many thinkers recognizing the value and benefits of playfulness, imagination, and embodiment.

It might have something to do with their ability to break down acetaldehyde naturally. Roughly 8 percent of the population is deficient in ALDH2, an enzyme that can disrupt the toxin. Quercetin further inhibits the enzyme, leading to symptoms.', 'Another possible explanation: the levels of quercetin in the wine. Grapes exposed to more sunlight tend to have more of it.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'At present, this is just a hypothesis.

78,11 Ferocious Facts About Wolverines,"['animals', 'science', 'lists']","['When you hear wolverine, your first thought may be the super-buff, clawed comic book character. That depiction isnâ\x80\x99t too different from the actual animal, a member of the weasel family that also has some pretty sharp claws. Once hunted nearly to extinction for their fur, wolverines in the lower 48 states now face threats from habitat fragmentation and climate change. In November 2023, they were added to the U.S. Endangered Species List (and their populations are decreasing worldwide). ', 'These animals are elusive, and much about them remains mysteriousâ\x80\x94but here are a few things we do know.', 'Wolverines can be found in boreal forests and tundra in North America, Europe, and Asia, where temperatures are cool even in the summer,Â\xa0so itâ\x80\x99s no surprise that these animals have evolved to survive frigid weather. They have big paws that that spreadÂ\xa0to twice their size when they hitÂ\xa0the ground, distributing their weight to help them travel through snow (they can run up to 30 mph), andÂ\xa0thick, oilyÂ\xa0fur thatÂ\xa0resists frostâ\x80\x94a fact that made them a target for fur traders.', 'At four feet tall and weighing up to 22 pounds (females) and 40 pounds (males), these fierce creatures are the largest members of the weasel family. Theyâ\x80\x99re small compared to some of the animals they compete with for food, but a wolverine has no problem standing up to wolves or a bear when a meal is on the line.', 'Wolverinesâ\x80\x94or Gulo gulo, scientifically speakingâ\x80\x94 are opportunistic eaters that hunt live prey including small animals like hares and rodents as well asÂ\xa0larger animals, like caribou,Â\xa0that are weak or ill. Theyâ\x80\x99ll also scavenge from any carcass they can get their claws on. (They eat vegetables and berries, too.) Frozen meat isnâ\x80\x99t a deterrent: An upper molar that sits sideways at 90 degreesÂ\xa0lets them rip into ice-covered carcasses. Their teeth are so sharp and strong that they can even eat bones. Once wolverines have food, they often bury it to save it for later; mere hours after a meal, theyâ\x80\x99ll go on the hunt again. Â\xa0', 'Wolverines use their non-retractable claws not just to bury food, but also to build dens; females dig as deep as 15 feet into snow to create burrows for their young. But the claws arenâ\x80\x99t just good for digging: They also allow the animals to climb trees (though, as the video above shows, theyâ\x80\x99re not exactly adept at it).', 'The stench comes from special anal glands that allow the animals to emit an offensive odor that protects their food and marks their territory (theyâ\x80\x99ll also use it when threatened, raising their tails like skunks). The fragrant odor has traces of methylbutanoic acid (think smelly cheese), methyldecanoic acid, and phenylacetic acid, and has a composition similar to those of pine and beech martens.', 'Folktales suggest that wolverines are the strongest animals in nature, but science has proved this to be largely untrue. These animals can be aggressive, but they only have a moderately strong bite: According to findings published in a 2007 study in the journal Ecology, theÂ\xa0animalâ\x80\x99sÂ\xa0bite force at the canines is 224 Newtons. Compare that to the highest number, 1646.7 Newtons, which belongs to the polar bear. Grizzlies, tigers, and lions arenâ\x80\x99t far behind.Â\xa0', 'The researchers also calculatedÂ\xa0bite force quotient (BFQ)Â\xa0to compare the bite force of animals with differing body sizes.

The palm civet (161.1) and the sun bear (160.5) both rank higher, as do several other weasels. The animal in the paper with the highest BFQ is Mustela nivalis, or least weasel, at 164. Outdoing them all is the Tasmanian devil, which has a BFQ of 181.', 'Wolverines can smell prey even when itâ\x80\x99s buried under 20 feet of snow, and have been known to find and kill hibernating animals.', 'When looking for food, wolverines can cover as many asÂ\xa015 miles in a single day. In the United States, these mostly solitary creatures each wander a territory of 47 square miles, and in Scandinavia, they roam individual territories that stretch over more than 270 miles. But thatâ\x80\x99s nothing compared to the distance one wolverine coveredÂ\xa0in 2009: Scientists figured out that the animal, whichÂ\xa0wasÂ\xa0spotted in Colorado, hadÂ\xa0trekked over 500 miles from its home in Wyoming.Â\xa0', 'In the wild, wolverines have a life span of seven to 12 years. When they reach sexual maturity, around age 2, one male will mate with several females he allows to live in his territory in the spring and summer months. Implantation of the fertilized eggs is delayed until the fall/winter, after which gestation lasts from four to seven weeks. FemalesÂ\xa0typically give birth to an average of three kits, which are under five inches long, weigh just a few ounces, and are covered in snow-white fur. By the time the kits are 6 weeks old, theyâ\x80\x99re exhibiting darker fur; each animal will develop unique coloration patterns on its face, neck, and chest.Â\xa0Kits stick with their moms for at least a year, and sometimes longer, and dad often returns to help out.', 'These animals use low-traffic human roadsÂ\xa0when traveling through their territory and can sneak bait out of traps set by scientists who want to collar them for study.', 'Fishers, badgers, marmots, bear cubs, and porcupines all look like wolverines from a distance.', 'Groups like the Citizen Wildlife Monitoring Project have spotted wolverines with remote cameras mounted in wilderness areas of Washington State, and the University of Alberta monitors wolverines by partnering with trappers and attaching GPS collars to the animals in western Canada.

79,4 Big Misconceptions About the Human Body,"['misconceptions', 'youtube channel', 'YouTube', 'the body', 'science', 'myths', 'video']","['Considering how familiar we all are with the human bodyâ\x80\x94as we all have oneâ\x80\x94there is a surprising number of enduring myths about it, from our five senses to the oft-quoted â\x80\x9cnormalâ\x80\x9d human body temperature of 98.6Â°F. Letâ\x80\x99s debunk a few that were featured in an episode of Misconceptions on YouTube. ', 'Thatâ\x80\x99s why your mom always told you to wear a hat when you went outside in winter, right? Well, noâ\x80\x94you donâ\x80\x99t actually lose a disproportionate amount of body heat through your head.', 'Rachel C. Vreeman and Aaron E. Carroll, both pediatricians, looked into the origins of this misconception in a humorous 2008 BMJ paper. They found that the heat-lost-through-your-head concept had been widely adopted by 1970. A U.S. Army survival manual issued that year recommended wearing hats in cold weather because â\x80\x9c40 to 45 percent of body heatâ\x80\x9d is lost through a personâ\x80\x99s noggin.', 'That figure apparently came from Army research conducted during the Cold War. According to hypothermia expert Daniel I. Sessler, during that now decades-old experiment, scientists dressed volunteers in cold weather survival suits and subjectedÂ\xa0them to freezing temperatures, after which the researchers evaluated the performance of the suits. It appeared that a significant percentage of body heat was lost through the headâ\x80\x94but as Vreeland and Carroll noted in 2008, the suits didnâ\x80\x99t include hats. â\x80\x9cBecause [the head] was the only part of the subjectsâ\x80\x99 bodies that was exposed to the cold, they lost most heat through their heads,â\x80\x9d they reported. If the same experiment had been done with the unfortunate volunteers wearing nothing but bathing suits, the head would not have contributed to more than 10 percent of the bodyâ\x80\x99s heat loss.Â\xa0', 'A 2006 study submerged eight participantsâ\x80\x99 heads in cold water and came up with essentially the same conclusion. After evaluating the effects of the dunking, researchers found that â\x80\x9cthe head does not contribute relatively more than the rest of the body to surface heat loss.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'But, that doesnâ\x80\x99t mean that winter hats are worthless, though surface body heat loss may be pretty consistent for any uncovered body part. Thereâ\x80\x99s reason to believe that colder heads lead to a disproportionately colder core body temperature. This might be because you have more close-to-the-surface blood vessels in your head, or, it might be because you donâ\x80\x99t tend to shiver when only your head is cold, meaning that you lose out on shiveringâ\x80\x99s warming effect.', 'If weâ\x80\x99ve learned anything from having our body temperature examined by total strangers at restaurants during the last few years, itâ\x80\x99s that 98.6Â°F is normal. Anything hotter than that means youâ\x80\x99re not only going to miss dinner, but also have an upcoming date with an uncomfortably long cotton swab.', 'Actually, weâ\x80\x99ve known for at least the past 25 years that the 98.6Â°F standard is a myth. So where did that curiously precise number come from?', 'Back in the mid-19th century, German physician Carl Wunderlich sought to understand how body temperature related to disease. At a hospital in Leipzig, where he was the medical director, Wunderlich took patientsâ\x80\x99 temperatures with a foot-long thermometer stuck into their armpitsâ\x80\x94over a million measurements in all.', 'From there, he determined what he deemed the â\x80\x9caverage normal temperature of the healthy human body.â\x80\x9d In his 1868 treatise On the Temperature in Diseases, he wrote that a fundamental principle of medical thermometry was that healthy human body temp varied between 37Â°C and 37.5Â°C (98.6Â°F and 99.5Â°F)â\x80\x94noting that the temperature of an armpit was closer to 37 degrees and that of â\x80\x9cthe rectum or vaginaâ\x80\x9d was a few tenths of a degree higher. He also suggested 38Â°C (100.4Â°F) as the threshold of fever, indicating the presence of disease.Â\xa0', 'The 98.6 figure that Americans are familiar with and seems so oddly specific is just a result of converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. It may give a misleading perception of precision for what was originally a range of fairly round numbers. But that may not be the only problem with citing Wunderlich as the final word on body temperature.Â\xa0', 'In the 1990s, a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland thought Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s number sounded a little too precise. Philip Makowiak borrowed one of Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s thermometers from the MÃ¼tter Museum in Philadelphia, and his suspicions grew. He saw that the temperature could be read only after the instrument had been in place for 20 minutes. He also believed that the armpit was a much less reliable locale for accurate measurements compared to the mouth or rectum. And, when he examined the accuracy of the instrumentâ\x80\x99s readings, Mackowiak found them to be several degrees off.Â\xa0', 'In his 1994 paper revisiting Wunderlichâ\x80\x99s findings, Mackowiak cited a 1950 study that noted differences in quote-unquote normal temperatures in the morning and at night, neither one of which was as high as 98.6. In Mackowiakâ\x80\x99s own analysis of 700 temperature readings from 148 adults at the University of Maryland, only 8 percent of the readings were 98.6. In this group, he wrote, â\x80\x9c98.6Â°F was not the overall mean temperature, the mean temperature of any particular time of day, the median temperature, or the single most frequently recorded temperature.â\x80\x9d Any similarly rigid standard for body temperature in Celsius, without accounting for healthy variation, would be similarly misleading.', 'And recent studies have pointed to another potentially confounding variable. Human beings may be literally cooling over time. A 2020 paper looked at body temperature databases from the Civil War era to 2017 and found a drop of .03Â°C per decade. According to New Scientist, itâ\x80\x99s possible that â\x80\x9cmodern people have fewer infections, thanks to vaccines and antibiotics, so our immune systems are less active and our body tissues less inflamed.â\x80\x9d', 'I should note that weâ\x80\x99re still in the early stages of research and not all experts are convinced the trend is real.Â\xa0', 'Youâ\x80\x99d think that something as fundamental as the number of bones in a human skeleton would be easy to figure out. You would be wrong. Scientists have been counting our clavicles and tallying our tibias for thousands of years, but they havenâ\x80\x99t always been able to agree on what that total number is. According to a communication in the journal Clinical Anatomy, medieval Europeans thought there were 248 bones. In 1543 the Padua surgeon Andreas Vesalius revised that to a little over 300. In 1732 the best estimates pegged it at 245, and then, in 1858, we finally got to the modern 206 thanks to Henry Gray of Grayâ\x80\x99s Anatomy. The reference book, not the TV show.', 'You could write all that off as scientific progressâ\x80\x94we had an erroneous idea and supplanted it with better information, that people have 206 bones. But as the dreamy doctors of Seattle Grace Hospital could no doubt tell us, not every human has 206 bones. Far from it.', 'Babies are born with more than 300 soft bones, mostly made of cartilage, connected by a tissue of cells called osteoblasts. These cells emit a sticky goo of collagen and sugar molecules that traps inorganic minerals. When enough of the minerals are caught in the gluey tissue, they harden and form compact bone, the type that provides our skeletonâ\x80\x99s structure.Â\xa0', 'As they grow, an infantâ\x80\x99s cartilage-based bones will dissolve and be replaced by clumps of osteoblasts that foster bone growth. Many cartilaginous bones will fuse through the process of mineralization, reducing the total number of bones in the process. In the limbs, bone formation continues through childhood and adolescence, and finally ends when the bones have reached their adult length.', 'You may know that a newbornâ\x80\x99s skull consists of several sections that fuse together. If you look at an adult human skull, you can see the lines, called sutures, where these plates meet.', 'So thatâ\x80\x99s how we go from 300 or so rubbery baby bones to the usual 206 mature bones. But not even every adult has that exact number.', 'For example, people can be born with an extra set of ribs accompanying the normal 12. These â\x80\x9csupernumerary ribsâ\x80\x9d are usually found along the lumbar vertebraeâ\x80\x94those in the lower backâ\x80\x94and typically go unnoticed until the person is X-rayed or autopsied. Thereâ\x80\x99s no scientific consensus on how common these extra ribs are, with estimates ranging from less than 1 percentÂ\xa0 to as much as 16 percent of the population having them.', 'Another phenomenon in which humans sport extra bones is polydactyly, or extra digits. You might have heard of Ernest Hemingwayâ\x80\x99s famous polydactyl cats, which have six toes instead of five on their front paws. Polydactyl humans can have an extra finger or toe on one or both extremities, usually due to mutations on one of several genes. The extra digits are most often located next to the outer digitâ\x80\x94the pinky finger or little toeâ\x80\x94though supernumerary thumbs and other fingers have been documented. These digits can sport extra bones, though not always a full set.Â\xa0', 'Polydactyly is surprisingly commonâ\x80\x94it affects about one in every 700 to 1000 babies. Devendra Suthar of India holds the Guinness World Record for the most supernumerary digits with 14 fingers and 14 toes.', 'For much of human history, humans were believed to have five senses: sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch. This idea can be tied to Aristotle. In his treatise on the nature of the soul, titled De Anima and written around 350 BCE, he argued that humans have five special senses, divided into two categories. He considered touch and taste to be senses that were perceived through direct contact. Sight, smell, and hearing were accomplished through a medium, in Aristotleâ\x80\x99s understandingâ\x80\x94either air or waterâ\x80\x94 which corresponded to two of the four elements that ancient Greeks believed made up the universe. In addition, Aristotle noted that each sense had its own designated organ, such as the nose for smell, which he felt further supported his theory of exactly five senses.', 'Today, scientists believe humans have many more senses than the basic five. Proprioception, for example, is the sense of knowing where our body parts are and what theyâ\x80\x99re doing. This sense makes it possible to run without staring at our feet or to pick up an object without looking at it. Equilibrioception is basically our sense of balance, which allows us to stand upright and bend over without falling, not to mention the ability to walk tightropes. Chronoception is our sense of time passing.', 'And like the number of bones in the human body, the different senses can sometimes join or overlap. Synesthesia is a well-known phenomenon in which people say they can see sounds, hear shapes, or even feel mathematical equations. Research suggests that synesthesia runs in families, pointing to a genetic component, but its cause is still not well understood. As much as 4 percent of the population has gene variants that might be connected to synesthesiaâ\x80\x94including such famous synesthetes as novelist Vladimir Nabokov and musician Duke Ellington, along with, perhaps, artist Vincent van Gogh.', 'This article has been updated from its original version.

Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to her privileged birth.', 'Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, she was the daughter of notorious Romantic poet George Gordon, Lord Byron. Ada was just a teenager when she met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage, who had invented the Difference Engine, a mechanical computer designed to produce error-free mathematical tables automatically. Babbage never built the actual machine due to personal setbacks and financing difficulty. By 1834 he had moved on to design his Analytical Engine, the first general purpose computer, which used punch cards for input and output. This machine also lacked financing and was never built. (Babbageâ\x80\x99s Difference Engine was finally constructed between 1985 and 2002â\x80\x94and it worked.)', 'Babbage was impressed with the brilliant young woman, and they corresponded for years, discussing math and computing as he developed the Analytical Engine. In 1842, Babbage gave a lecture on the engine at the University of Turin. Luigi Menabrea, a mathematician (and future Italian prime minister), transcribed the lecture in French. Ada, then in her late 20s and known as the Countess of Lovelace, was commissioned to translate the transcript into English. Lovelace added her own notes to the lecture, which ended up being three times as long as the actual transcript. It was published in 1843.', 'Lovelaceâ\x80\x99s notes made it clear that she understood the Analytical Engine as well as Babbage did. Furthermore, she understood how to make it do the things computers do. She suggested the data input that would program the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, which is now considered the first computer program. But more than that, Lovelace was a visionary: She understood that numbers could be used to represent more than just quantities, and a machine that could manipulate numbers could be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. She predicted that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, produce graphics, and be useful to science. Of course, all that came trueâ\x80\x94100 years later.', 'Babbage was so impressed with Lovelaceâ\x80\x99s contributions, he dubbed her â\x80\x9cthe enchantress of numbers.â\x80\x9d', 'How did a young woman get the opportunity to show the world her talents in the 19th century? Mathematical intelligence was not the only thing Ada had going for her. As the daughter of Lord Byron and his first wife Anne Isabella Noel Byron, she enjoyed entry into the aristocracy. Their marriage broke up shortly after Ada was born.', 'Lady Byron, who studied literature, science, philosophy, and mathematics, was determined that Ada not follow in her fatherâ\x80\x99s footsteps. Instead of art and literature, Ada was tutored in mathematics and science. Ada excelled in all her studies, and her interests were wide-ranging. Ada became a baroness in 1835 when she married William King, 8th Baron King; the couple had three children. In 1838, she became Countess of Lovelace when her husband was elevated as 1st Earl of Lovelace.

82,Why Some Male Lions Donât Have Manes,"['animals', 'science', 'zoos']","[""Like a cheetahâ\x80\x99s spots or a zebraâ\x80\x99s stripes, aÂ\xa0male lionâ\x80\x99s mane is perhaps the animalâ\x80\x99s most iconic feature.Â\xa0But there is actually a significant amount of variation in the king of the jungle's â\x80\x99do, from voluminous golden locks to none at all.Â\xa0"", 'For years, scientists identified different lion species and subspecies, in part, by the length of their locks. They believed that mane length was a genetic characteristic, passed down from generation to generation.', 'But a 2006 study by Bruce Patterson, now the curator emeritus of mammals at the Field Museum in Chicago, revealed that the length can largely be attributed to climate. According to the museum, the temperature of a zoo lionâ\x80\x99s environment is responsible for up to half of the span and density of its mane. While genetics may also be a factorâ\x80\x94some of the big cats may be predisposed to longer, more luxurious manesâ\x80\x94temperature can cause a huge amount of variation. This means scientists may need to reevaluate some of their existing taxonomy.', 'Patterson studied lions at 17 zoos across the United States, recording area temperatures and the length of the hair around each mammalâ\x80\x99sÂ\xa0neck. He found that those in colder climates had significantly longer strands than those in warmer areas. Because manes take energy to grow and maintain, lions in warmer temperatures, who donâ\x80\x99t need the ring of hair to keep warm, simply grow smaller ones.', 'While itâ\x80\x99s relatively rare, some lions in particularly extreme heat donâ\x80\x99t grow manes at all. In fact, Pattersonâ\x80\x99s study was inspired by two such lionsâ\x80\x94the famous Tsavo man-eaters. ', 'Back in the late 19th century, the Tsavo lions hunted and killed as many as 135 people in Tsavo, Kenya. They were eventually shot, killed, and donated to the Field Museum where, close to a century later, Patterson became transfixed by their maneless condition. â\x80\x9cEven a small mane can be imposing in hot dry climates, where the costs of overheating are great and most male lions have little or no mane,â\x80\x9d Patterson said in a Field Museum news article. â\x80\x9cThis is the case in Tsavo, Kenya, where most lions are maneless.â\x80\x9d', 'As for why the Tsavo lions went after people, Patterson and his colleagues posited that the animalsâ\x80\x99 dental issuesâ\x80\x94which included broken and missing teeth and abscessesâ\x80\x94could have contributed to their human-centric diet. Patterson said in a statement that â\x80\x9cHumans are so much easier to catchâ\x80\x9d than typical lion prey like wildebeests.', 'Now that you know why some male lions have manes and some donâ\x80\x99t, find out whether lions are really brave and why the animals were so funny looking in old illustrations.', 'A version of this story ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68425/why-some-male-lions-dont-have-manes

Hereâ\x80\x99s what you need to know to catch the once-every-13-months spectacle.', 'Roughly once a year, Earth comes between Jupiter and the sun.

On Thursday, November 2 and early morning of November 3, 2023, the sun will be in the perfect position to fully illuminate Jupiterâ\x80\x99s gaseous surface.', 'Another factor influencing Jupiterâ\x80\x99s spectacular appearance: the planet reaches the closest point in its orbit to Earth one day earlier on November 1. On that night, Jupiter will be a mere 370 million miles away from us, making it appear larger than usual. That, combined with its exceptional brightness, positions Jupiterâ\x80\x99s opposition as the best time of year to see the planet from wherever you are.', 'To see Jupiter at its brightest, wait until the sun has completely set and the sky is dark on the night of Thursday, November 2.

84,Why Do We Fear Clowns? A New Study Sheds Some Light on Coulrophobia,"['news', 'science', 'weird', 'pop culture']","['Fears and phobias can seemingly be hardwired into us as a protective mechanism, from flinching at fire to backing away from a snake. But coulrophobia, or a fear of clowns, is different. Why be fearful of a character designed to spread joy and mirth? Why does the antagonist of It, Stephen Kingâ\x80\x99s landmark novel, take the form of a clown to terrify the children of Derry, Maine?', 'A study published in Frontiers in Psychology may help explain it. Researchers at the University of South Wales polled 528 people who expressed a fear of clowns or clowning in an attempt to drill down into the source of their apprehension.', 'After tallying the results, the team was able to identify some pervasive reasoning behind the phobia. One key factor is the lack of information a clown can communicate about their thought process. Their make-up, while expressive, is like a mask and can obfuscate their intentions.', 'â\x80\x9cThereâ\x80\x99s something about not being able to read facial expressions,â\x80\x9d lead author and psychology professor Philip John Tyson told The Washington Post. â\x80\x9cAnd the fact that there might be something hidden and dangerous, there might be harmful intent behind the makeup.â\x80\x9d', 'That makeup, which often consists of white paint and a red mouth, can also infer pallor and disease, as though the clown might be carrying a contagious illness.', 'Another upsetting factor is a clownâ\x80\x99s unpredictability: Clowns will do anything for a laugh, and that inscrutability can be unnerving for people.', 'Respondents also cited the not-quite-human look of a clown as well as their depictions in popular culture, though the latter seems to be more a reflection of coulrophobia than a cause. And only rarely did people cite a first-hand negative experience with a clown as the source of the problem.', 'Ultimately, people appear to frown at clowns because their cheerful disposition can mask something sinister. Of course, the same is true for just about any human.

85,"10 Facts About Ivory-Billed Woodpeckers, Americaâs Famous (Probably) Extinct Bird","['birds', 'extinction', 'lists']","['If youâ\x80\x99ve seen news stories about ivory-billed woodpeckers over the past few years, you might, very understandably, be confused: It seems like some expert is always announcing either that the birds are definitely extinct, or, that they definitely still exist somewhere. But how much do you really know about the charismatic â\x80\x9cLord God birdâ\x80\x9d? Here are 10 facts to introduce this legendary (maybe?) extinct avianâ\x80\x94and a look-alike species that might be the source of all the rumors.', 'English naturalist Mark Catesby dubbed the bird the â\x80\x9clargest white-billed woodpeckerâ\x80\x9d and wrote that they â\x80\x9csubsist mainly on ants, woodworms, and other insects, which they hew out of rotten trees.â\x80\x9d In 1751, Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus drew on this description when he named the species Picus principalus, or â\x80\x9cfirst woodpecker.â\x80\x9d Their official, modern scientific name is Campephilus principalis . And their famous nicknameâ\x80\x94the â\x80\x9cLord God birdâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94comes from the exclamations of amazement uttered by birdwatchers seeing one for the first time.', 'Ivory-billed woodpeckers were considered birds of lowland swamps; famed 19th-century naturalist Alexander Wilson wrote that they â\x80\x9cseek the most towering trees of the forest, seemingly particularly attached to those prodigious cypress swamps, whose crowded giant sons stretch their bare and blasted or moss-hung arms midway to the skies.â\x80\x9d However, swamps may simply be where the last untouched forests able to support them remained, following extensive logging.', 'Nineteenth- and early 20th-century naturalists described as many as 11 ivory-billed woodpeckers foraging together in the same dead tree, stripping off the bark in search of the enormous beetle larvae that were their favorite food. They were probably nomadic, seeking out places where large numbers of trees had recently been killed by flooding or storms. In spring, they paired off and excavated huge cavities in the snags, in which they raised one to four young.', 'Habitat destruction and fragmentation led to these birdsâ\x80\x99 downfall. Their last stronghold in the United States was a patch of old-growth forest in Louisiana called the Singer Tract. Seven pairs were believed to have nested there in the 1930s, but the logging company that owned the rights to the land ignored pleas from the Audubon Society and multiple state governors and federal agencies to preserve it as a refugeâ\x80\x94and began clear-cutting. The final universally accepted sighting of an ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in the remnants of the Singer Tract in April 1944.', 'A distinct subspecies of ivory-billed woodpecker lived in montane pine forests on the island of Cuba. Although scientists hadnâ\x80\x99t thoroughly documented its population since before the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s, sporadic sightings continued to be reported through the 1960s and â\x80\x9870s. Finally, an international team of ornithologists observed a male and female in a remote area of Cuba in 1986 and 1987. Return trips in the 1990s failed to turn up any trace of them, however, and logging in the region was ongoing. Experts now believe that Cubaâ\x80\x99s ivory-billed woodpeckers went extinct around 1990.', 'They were very large birds: over a foot-and-a-half long from beak to tail. They ranked just behind their close cousin the imperial woodpecker (native to Mexico, now extinct due to habitat loss) and the more distantly related great slaty woodpecker (extant but vulnerable) of Southeast Asia.', 'Pileated woodpeckers are smaller than ivory-billed woodpeckers and lack their namesake white bills and large white wing patches. But pileated woodpeckers are still pretty big (at well over a foot long, theyâ\x80\x99re the largest woodpecker still present in North America), and they do share ivory-billed woodpeckersâ\x80\x99 distinctive red crests and white-striped necks. The pileated species may be responsible for at least some of the supposed ivory-bill sightings that continue to be reported occasionally in the U.S.', 'In 2005, a Cornell Lab of Ornithology-led team published a paper in the journal Science assembling evidence that ivory-billed woodpeckers still lived in eastern Arkansas, based on sightings, call recordings, and one short, low-quality video clip. Further searches of the area failed to turn up additional proof, however, and other bird identification experts believe that the video likely showed a pileated woodpecker.', 'The ivory-billed woodpecker was officially listed as an endangered species in 1967. A 2021 proposal to remove the birds from the endangered species list and formally declare them extinctâ\x80\x94which cited the continued lack of proof that living ivory-bills still existâ\x80\x94was immediately controversial: Ivory-billed woodpecker proponents worried it would eliminate any incentive to protect what they believed to be the birdsâ\x80\x99 last remaining areas of habitat in Arkansas, Louisiana, and other states.', 'Another paper claiming the woodpeckersâ\x80\x99 continued existence, this time led by scientists from the National Aviary in Pittsburgh and drawing on data collected in Louisiana, was published in May 2023 in the journal Ecology and Evolution. The most noteworthy new bit of evidence this time around consisted of drone footage that appeared to show possible ivory-billed woodpeckers flying between trees. Many ornithologists and birders remain unconvinced (those pesky pileateds again!), but as of 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has yet to make an official decision on the plan to remove them from the endangered species and declare them extinct once and for all.

88,11 Surprising Facts About Vampire Bats,"['animals', 'halloween', 'lists', 'science']","['Bats are firmly rooted in Western vampire lore, but only three species out of some 1100 in the order Chiroptera actually have a taste for blood. Vampire bats are the only mammals in the world that live on blood alone, and the unique challenges of that diet make them some of the most specialized, fascinating, and downright weird animals in nature.', 'The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi) are closely related and grouped together in the subfamilyÂ\xa0Desmodontinae. Their ranges overlap in parts of Central and South America, so, in what might be an effort to avoid competition with each other, the species go after different prey. The common vampire bat feeds primarily on the blood of mammalsâ\x80\x94ranging from tapirs to horses to the occasional humanâ\x80\x94and seems to have a preference for livestock animals. The hairy-legged vampire bat, meanwhile, lives almost exclusively on bird blood, while the white-winged vampire bat is more versatile and drinks from both birds and mammals.', 'Other bats with less grisly diets got a bad rap from European explorers in the Americas. The Europeans had heard stories about blood-drinking bats and encountered Native people and livestock that had been bitten in the night and, without any real knowledge of the animalsâ\x80\x99 diets, began labeling different bats as vampires willy nilly, usually applying the term to bigger and/or uglier ones. Bats that lived on insects or even fruit were assumed to be vampires thanks to their appearance, and the association stuck when they were scientifically described and saddled with names like Vampyrum spectrum and Pteropus vampyrus. Meanwhile, when a naturalist finally got his hands on an actual vampire, D. rotundus, no one one believed his assertions that it drank blood, and he made no mention of it in his description.', 'When the bats feed, they use their teeth to shear away hair or feathers from a small spot and then cut into their victimâ\x80\x99s flesh with their sharp incisors. (According to zoologists at Chicagoâ\x80\x99s Field Museum, even the teeth on old, preserved bat skulls in museum collections are sharp enough to cut someone handling them carelessly.) Rather than actively suck the blood from the wound like their namesakes, the bats let the physics of capillary action do the work. They lap at the blood and specialized grooves on their lips, tongues, and/or roof or their mouths suction it up. A protein in the batsâ\x80\x99 saliva called a plasminogen activator prevents the blood from clotting and keeps it flowing freely while they drink.', 'The white-winged vampire bats have a few tricks for feeding on domestic chickens without startling the birds. Sometimes, theyâ\x80\x99ll approach a hen and mimic a chick by nuzzling up to her brood patch. This featherless section of skin on the henâ\x80\x99s underside is densely packed with blood vessels and is used to transfer heat to her eggs or chicks during nesting. The vessels make an easy target for the bat, and if the hen thinks itâ\x80\x99s her baby cuddling up to her, sheâ\x80\x99ll sit on the bat to give it access to drink. Other times, the bats will climb up on a henâ\x80\x99s back, mimicking the touch and weight of a mounting rooster and sending the hen into the crouching stance they take before mating. The bat can then shimmy up to the henâ\x80\x99s neck for a bite and sheâ\x80\x99ll stay in that position until the bat hops off.', 'White-winged vampires will also take their meals in the trees instead of the barnyard. While a bird roosts on a branch, the bat sneaks up on it from below, crawling along the underside of the branch and staying out of sight. Once itâ\x80\x99s directly underneath its prey, the bat bites the birdâ\x80\x99s big rear-pointing toe and drinks its fill.', 'D. ecaudata also feeds in the trees, but doesnâ\x80\x99t bother with subtlety like its cousin. Theyâ\x80\x99ll often land directly on a bird and hang from its body upside-down with their feet while biting around the birdâ\x80\x99s cloaca, the all-purpose entrance and exit for the intestinal, reproductive, and urinary tracts. The maneuver is helped by the batâ\x80\x99s calcar, a bony spur that comes off the ankle bone. Itâ\x80\x99s absent in some bats and underdeveloped in others, but the hairy-legged vampireâ\x80\x99s protrudes noticeably and is used by the bat like an extra digit to help it hang on.', 'It has evolved to be as nimble there as it is in flight. While most other bats are awkward crawlers, the common vampire can move with a quick run-like gait or hop along the ground, supporting its weight on its hind legs and using its wings and elongated thumbs to steer and push off the ground. This comes in handy for chasing after prey on the move and for jumping out of the way if it needs to.', 'Feeding for common vampires is often risky, given that their preferred victim, the domestic cow, is several thousand times larger than they are. They usually bite cows on the area of the leg just above and behind the hoof, since the skin is relatively thin and the blood vessels run close to the surface. One step backwards, and a bat could be squashed if it hadnâ\x80\x99t figured out how to run or make impressive three-foot leaps into the air.', 'Their energy needs require them to consume half their body weight during each 20- to 30-minute feeding session. Their bodies have adapted to lighten that load, and their stomach lining rapidly absorbs much of the bloodâ\x80\x99s water content and sends it to the kidneys so it can be excreted. The bats can process their meal so quickly that they may begin disposing of it before theyâ\x80\x99re even finished with it, and start urinating just a few minutes into the feeding.', 'Mother bats regurgitate previously drunk blood for their offspring until the babies are old enough to hunt on their own. Other related bats and even unrelated ones have also been observed puking blood up for one another in a reciprocal arrangement. If a bat canâ\x80\x99t find a meal one night, one of its roost-mates may share some of its meal. In the future, the bat who was fed is highly likely to return the favor. If it cheats, or takes a blood donation without ever giving back, it may find that it gets the cold shoulder the next time it needs help.', 'They also have a well-developed senses of smell and heat-seeking facesâ\x80\x94their wrinkly, leaf-shaped noses are loaded with nerves that are, in turn, loaded with proteins that are sensitive to the infrared radiation given off by warm-blooded animals. They also have finely tuned hearing and specialized neurons that react only to the sound of breathing. They can even distinguish the breathing sounds made by different individuals, and may be able to remember the unique sonic components of an individual animalâ\x80\x99s breathing, allowing them to return to the same reliable source of blood night after night.', 'Animals that are adventurous eaters learn to avoid potentially toxic foods through trial and error. They try something new, get sick, and then avoid those flavors in the futureâ\x80\x94a process called conditioned taste aversion. But vampire bats donâ\x80\x99t seem to learn from experience. ', 'In experiments [PDF], biologists have given vampire bats and their fruit- and insect-eating cousins treats seasoned with different, unfamiliar flavors, and then induced vomiting. At their next few meals, the bats were given the choice between their normal food and food flavored with the same seasonings from before. While the other bats avoided the flavors they associated with getting sick after the first meal, the vampires dug in to both flavored and unflavored blood. ', 'The researchers think that the vampires either lost the ability to make these associations because their diet doesnâ\x80\x99t present a variety of flavors and it wasnâ\x80\x99t needed, or maybe that they had to lose it early on in their blood-drinking history to make the diet viable.', 'A version of this story was published in 2013; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/53128/11-bloody-facts-about-vampire-bats
89,"What Is a Lava Tube, and Where Can I Find One?","['travel', 'nature', 'news']","['Caves and volcanoes donâ\x80\x99t often go hand-in-hand in our imaginations. When we think of caves, we imagine still, dark spaces underground. Volcanoes, on the other hand, loom above us with a threatening explosive power. But in fact, the second most common type of cave in the world is made from the power of volcanoes. They are lava tubes.', 'Lava tubes are cylindrical caves made from cooled, hardened lava. Inside, you wonâ\x80\x99t find colorful limestone formations. Rather, youâ\x80\x99re faced with inky black igneous rock making up the floor, walls, and ceiling. Grooves on the walls show former lava flow levels, and lavacicles, stalactites formed from lava cooling as it drips from the ceiling, often hang above. Creatures such as bats, spiders, and various insects often make their homes inside.', 'But how does a tube of rock come from a stream of lava? Because lava is a fluid, it flows in the same way a river does. But the outside edges of that lava stream cool much faster than the inside because of its exposure to the outside air. So, just as a pond freezes over in the cold, the edges of the lava stream begin to harden, eventually forming a shell and encasing the flowing lava. The lava inside is then insulated and becomes superheated, causing it to erode the surface underneath. This erosion creates the lava tubeâ\x80\x99s circular shape. When the eruption is over, the lava slowly drains from the tube. It can take more than a year for the cave to cool completely, but when it does, animals start to move in.', 'Of course, not all lava tubes are safe for human exploration. Many still have active lava flows within, holding incredible (and incredibly dangerous) heat. The lava within active lava tubes in Hawaiâ\x80\x99i, for example, is around 2200Â° F (or 1250Â° C). People are therefore only allowed inside lava tubes that are completely drained and cooled. The National Park Service maintains many of these lava tubes, so itâ\x80\x99s generally a safe experience, but as with any natural area, visitation is at your own risk. Some potential hazards are rockfall and low to no lighting; but the biggest problem youâ\x80\x99ll likely face when visiting is tripping. Space can also get pretty tight in some of the tubes, so if youâ\x80\x99re claustrophobic, it might not be the venture for you.', 'Because of their volcanic nature, lava tubes are most commonly found in regions with a lot of geothermal activity. Hawaiâ\x80\x99i, in particular, has countless lava tubes because the islands themselves were formed from volcanic forces. This also means they have some of the most spectacular lava tubes around. But there are also lava tubes along the west coast of the United States, such as at Californiaâ\x80\x99s Lava Beds National Monument and Lassen Volcanic National Park or Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in Idaho. In fact, theyâ\x80\x99re on almost every continent; you can visit lava tubes in Iceland, South Korea, Kenya, and Australia. If youâ\x80\x99re able to arrange some extraterrestrial travel, theyâ\x80\x99re also on the moon and on Mars.Â\xa0', 'Pretty much anywhere you can find volcanoes, you can find lava tubes.

90,How Does Sword Swallowing Really Work?,"['science', 'big questions', 'Tommy Swerdlow']","['Sword swallowing is not just an elaborate visual trick. Trained performers really do stick at least 16 inches of blade into their bodies. Just how do they manage that? Itâ\x80\x99s all in the esophagus.', 'To master the ancient art of sword swallowing, practitioners spend many years learning how to wield control over involuntary bodily reflexes, such as their gag reflex. As a 2006 study of sword swallowers describes, performers train by â\x80\x9crepeatedly putting fingers down the throat, but other objects are used including spoons, paint brushes, knitting needles, and plastic tubes before the swallower commonly progresses to a bent wire coat hanger.â\x80\x9d The study goes on to note, perhaps unsurprisingly, that â\x80\x9csore throats are common.â\x80\x9d', 'The sword has to pass through the upper esophageal sphincterâ\x80\x94the muscles at the top of the esophagus that you use when burping, eating, vomiting, etc. Then, the sword swallower has to bend their body so that the blade passes around their heart. Finally, the sword must move through the lower esophageal sphincter, which is the entrance to the stomach. These muscles move involuntarilyâ\x80\x94theyâ\x80\x99re what keep the contents of your stomach from creeping back up your throatâ\x80\x94and when one weakens these, it can cause acid reflux.', 'Through intense training, sword swallowers learn to open this sphincter on command, which is what allows the sword to pass into the stomach. One practitioner told The Washington Post that she didnâ\x80\x99t even know how she did it, using only intense concentration to relax the muscles. Eventually, a sword swallower can learn to hold multiple swords in their throat at once.', 'And yes, itâ\x80\x99s dangerous.

92,Why Do We Get Shivers Down Our Spines?,"['big questions', 'college-weekend', 'music', 'science', 'the body']","['Picture this: Youâ\x80\x99re sitting on your couch in the dark alone, watching a scary movie. The killer is walking toward an unsuspecting victim, then suddenly jumps out at her. In that moment, the hairs on your body stand up, and you get a shiver down your spine. When you go for a walk on a crisp morning, the same thing happens. When the music swells during your favorite song, you get the shivers again, this time with the little goosebumps on your arms that appear when you get that sensation. What is going on?', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s a good reason for shivers and goosebumps: Theyâ\x80\x99re your bodyâ\x80\x99s response to emotion or stress. We got this from our animal ancestors: When they were cold, the hair on their bodies would stand upâ\x80\x94the movement of the arrector pili muscle would cause the skin to contract, raising each hairâ\x80\x94to provide an extra layer of insulation. ', 'This response is also in play when animals feel threatened; their natural reaction is to try to look bigger than their attacker, so their skin and hair expand to play up that effect. The part of the brain called the hypothalamus is what controls this reaction. ', 'Shivering can also be a sign that the body is attempting to warm itself up. According to a post on McGill Universityâ\x80\x99s Office for Science and Society blog, â\x80\x9cShivering is our bodyâ\x80\x99s way of raising its core temperature to bring it back to a state of homeostasis ... If body temperature dips below the normal 98.6Â° F (37Â° Celsius), we will start shivering, which will then cause muscles to contract and then relax very rapidly, thereby expending energy to warm up the whole body. These muscle contractions cause limbs to shake and also teeth to chatter. Shivering, similar to blood pressure and heart rate, is an automatic and totally involuntary function that the body performs to regulate itself.â\x80\x9d', 'So why do goosebumpsâ\x80\x94also known as cutis anserina or piloerectionâ\x80\x94appear when itâ\x80\x99s not for a functional purpose like looking larger or creating insulation? Itâ\x80\x99s because our emotions are also connected with the hypothalamus, so sometimes goosebumps are just our body reacting to our brainâ\x80\x99s signals of intense emotion. ', 'When we feel things like love, fear, or sadness, the hypothalamus sends a signal to our bodies that produces adrenaline in our blood. The signal triggers the arrector pili muscles to contract, and then we have goosebumps caused by emotion. The sudden adrenaline rush may also cause sweaty palms, tears, increased blood pressure, or shivers. That shiver down your spine goes goes by several names: Some call it frisson, or â\x80\x9cshiverâ\x80\x9d in French, especially when music is involved; others go with terms like aesthetic chillsÂ\xa0[PDF] orÂ\xa0psychogenic shivers.', 'When we watch movies or listen to music and get shivers, itâ\x80\x99s a mixture of subjective emotions toward the film or song and physiological arousal. If we watch a movie or hear a song we get excited about, or one that makes us sad, the hypothalamus reacts to the sudden change in emotion and we physicallyÂ\xa0feel the shiver along our spine.', 'Now that you know why we get shivers down our spines (even when weâ\x80\x99re not cold), read up on people who can control their goosebumps.', 'A version of this story ran in 2012; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/12879/why-do-we-get-shivers-our-spines

Thatâ\x80\x99s essentially what happened in the 18th century, and itâ\x80\x99s the reason we still call koalas â\x80\x9cbearsâ\x80\x9d today, even when we know better.', 'In the late 1700s, English-speaking settlers happened upon a small animal in Australia that looked like a small, gray bear with a pouch. It was soon given the scientific name Phascolarctos cinereus, which is derived from Greek words meaning â\x80\x9cash-gray pouched bear.â\x80\x9d Essentially, naturalists had named the unknown animal based on its appearance and behavior, and people didnâ\x80\x99t realize until later that the presence of a pouch is a dead giveaway that an animal is definitely not a bear.', 'According to Live Science, koalas and bears both belong to the same class, Mammalia (i.e. theyâ\x80\x99re mammals). Then their taxonomic branches diverge: Koalas belong to an infraclass called Marsupialia. Marsupials, unlike bears, give birth to their offspring when theyâ\x80\x99re still underdeveloped, and then carry them around in pouches. Even if koalas look just as cuddly as bear cubs, theyâ\x80\x99re much more closely related to other marsupials like kangaroos and wombats.', 'Over time, people adopted a name that the Aboriginal Darug people in Australia used for the animal,Â\xa0koala. (The Oxford English Dictionaryâ\x80\x99s first citation for the word dates back to the writings of Sir Everard Home in 1808: â\x80\x9cThe koala is another species of the wombat,â\x80\x9d Home wrote. The OED notes that â\x80\x9ckoala was perhaps originally a misreading of koola.â\x80\x9d)', 'But bear still stuck as a modifier, and scientists never went back and replaced arctos (from arktos, Greek for bear) in its genusÂ\xa0Phascolarctos with something more accurate. So, technically speaking, koalas are still called bears, even by scientists.', 'Now that you know why we call koalas â\x80\x9cbears,â\x80\x9d check out what they sound likeâ\x80\x94we promise youâ\x80\x99ll be surprised.', 'A version of this story ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/612186/why-koalas-are-called-koala-bears
95,8 Victorian Scientists Who Investigated Ghosts,"['ghosts', 'science', 'weird']","['The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in ghosts, and sÃ©ances were all the rage. When the famous Fox sisters of Hydesville, New York, claimed in 1848 that they could speak to spirits that communicated by knocking on a table, the fad really took offâ\x80\x94and more mediums came forward to manifest ectoplasm, bring messages from beyond the grave, and make objects fly mysteriously through the air.', 'The possibilities presented by the existence of a spiritual realm inspired the growth of spiritualism, which gripped the United States and the United Kingdom in the mid- to late-19th century. Intellectuals of the day began to take an interest in the paranormal. Some embraced psychical research, while others remained skeptical and tried to debunk the sensational stories. Here are eight 19th-century scientists who investigated ghosts.', 'In the 1850s, table turning became a popular pursuit after the humble table became the preferred conduit for conversing with spirits beyond the veil. Scientist Michael Faraday, best known for his discoveries of the laws of electrolysis and electromagnetic induction, took an interest in the science behind table turning in 1853, keen to investigate if the phenomenon could have an electrical or magnetic cause.', 'After conducting experiments into table turning by secretly monitoring the muscle movements of participants during a sÃ©ance, Faraday published his conclusions in the Times newspaper on June 30, 1853. He concluded that that table turning wasnâ\x80\x99t a spiritual phenomenon, but a physical oneâ\x80\x94and that participants were unconsciously moving the table themselves but were unaware they were doing so. Without fully understanding the mechanism behind the unconscious force, Faraday had stumbled upon the ideomotor effect.', 'Physiologist William Carpenter suggested the ideomotor response could explain how unconscious bodily actions may be responsible for the perceived motion of spiritualist tools like dowsing rods, pendulums, and Ouija boards. (He coined the word ideomotor in a 1852 paper.) Carpenter argued that Ouija boards, rather than providing spirits with a method to communicate with the living, demonstrated that any messages â\x80\x9creceivedâ\x80\x9d were caused by the subconscious movements of the participants. Carpenterâ\x80\x99s theory became highly influential in the field of psychical research because it offered a rational, scientific explanation for a variety of supernatural spectacles.', 'Naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace came up with the theory of evolution by natural selection independently of Charles Darwin. The two corresponded on the subject before Darwin scooped him by publishing On the Origin of Species in 1859. Wallace never gained the plaudits that Darwin enjoyed, and his contribution to the history of science was overshadowed by what many contemporaries saw as his ill-advised interest in spiritualism.', 'Wallace took the theory of evolution to another level by suggesting that it pointed to the existence of a supernatural realm. He believed that, unlike animals that evolved through natural selection, humans must be different because they had developed the ability to speak, make music, and do complex mathematics. Despite the ridicule he endured, Wallace continued to enthusiastically support spiritualist inquiry; he wrote numerous articles in defense of the continued existence of the human spirit after death and advocated for the authenticity of spirit photographs.', 'Nobel Prize-winning physicists Pierre and Marie Curie gained accolades for their discoveries of the radioactive elements radium and poloniumâ\x80\x94and it was their investigations into these seemingly invisible physical forces that gave them an interest in other unexplained phenomena. In 1905, the pair and some fellow scientists took part in a number of sÃ©ances with the celebrated spiritual medium Eusapia Palladino. The medium produced several supernatural happenings during the sÃ©ances, including strange noises, levitating tables, and flying objects. The assembled investigators struggled to debunk everything that had occurred, and Pierre especially felt sure that â\x80\x9cthe phenomena that we saw appeared inexplicable as trickery.â\x80\x9d', 'Marie did not publicly support the concept of spiritualism, but after Pierreâ\x80\x99s sudden death in a carriage accident at the age of 46, she began writing to him in her diary. Her unsendable letters suggest that, on some level, she believed in the ability to communicate with loved ones in the afterlife.', 'William James (brother of novelist Henry and writer Alice James) laid the foundations of American psychology and was one of the founding members of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1885. The ASPR was an attempt to apply rigorous scientific standards to the investigation and exploration of the psychic realm, including telepathy, mediumship, and ghosts. James wrote excitedly to his cousin Kitty Prince that â\x80\x9cghosts, second sight, spiritualism, & all sorts of hobgoblins are going to be â\x80\x98investigatedâ\x80\x99 by the most high toned & â\x80\x98culturedâ\x80\x99 members of the community.â\x80\x9d', 'James accepted that many mediums were fraudulent, but he refused to believe this meant that all should be dismissed. He placed his faith in one psychic in particular, Leona Piper of Boston, after she appeared to bring him a message from his recently deceased infant son.', 'In the early 19th century, physician and public health reformer John Ferriar made efforts to discover if ghosts were truly supernatural or if they had a more prosaic explanation. He published his findings as â\x80\x9cAn Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitionsâ\x80\x9d in 1813.', 'â\x80\x9cThe forms of dead, or absent persons have been seen, and their voices have been heard, by witnesses whose testimony is entitled to belief,â\x80\x9d he wrote. He pondered how sane people could believe they had seen or heard a ghost, and concluded that ghosts were in fact the result of â\x80\x9cwaking dreams composed of the shreds and patches of past sensations.â\x80\x9d Ferriar argued that apparitions could be created by over-excited minds through mental projection, making ghosts a psychological phenomenon rather than a supernatural one.', 'Eleanor â\x80\x9cNoraâ\x80\x9d Sidgwick was a mathematician, suffragist, and principal of Newnham College of the University of Cambridge. She became a key member of the Society for Psychical Research and later served as its president. Like its American counterpart co-founded by William James, the Society for Psychical Research was one of the most respected organizations exploring supernatural phenomena and included scientists, academics, and notable people among its members, such as Arthur Conan Doyle, chemist William Crookes, and physicist Oliver Lodge.', 'Sidgwick undertook a great deal of research for the SPR, looking into telepathy, mediums, and levitation. Her findings were mostly skeptical, though she believed that telepathy was a genuine but rare natural phenomenon. In 1891, fellow SPR member Alfred Russel Wallace asked the society to investigate spirit photography because he believed that many existing portraits purporting to show the inexplicable appearance of ghosts were genuine. Sidgwick took up the task and published a paper, â\x80\x9cOn Spirit Photographs,â\x80\x9d which essentially debunked it and revealed many of the tricks used to create the ghostly effects.', 'William F. Barrett was a noted physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society, but today heâ\x80\x99s best remembered for his research into the paranormal. Barrett was at the forefront of the burgeoning field of psychical investigation, co-founding both the UKâ\x80\x99s Society for Psychical Research and the American Society for Psychical Research.', 'Barrett was especially interested in spiritualism, poltergeists, and deathbed visions of dead people, believing that these phenomena could indicate the existence of life after death. He argued that measurable phenomena such as sounds waves and radiation could potentially provide clues to how spirits persisted. Barrettâ\x80\x99s credulous position, however, placed him at odds with many fellow scientists and members of SPR, who were far more skeptical and concerned about maintaining scientific rigor. After he was criticized for failing to notice the simple conjuring tricks employed by certain mediums, Barrett turned his attention away from ghosts.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/victorian-ghosts-science
96,A History of the Thereminâthe Soviet Science Experiment That Took Hollywood By Storm,"['science', 'technology', 'sound', 'music', 'history', 'weird', 'news', 'government', 'Hollywood', 'Lenin']","['The eerie, futuristic tone of the theremin is unmistakable. In horror and science fiction, it may signal the arrival of a flying saucer, a characterâ\x80\x99s impending psychotic break, or a twisted science experiment gone wrong. The electronic nature of the noise suggests otherworldly origins, and its use in films like The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) has made it synonymous with the uncanny and bizarre.Â\xa0', 'The instrument itself, however, is hard to recognize on sight. Consisting of a box with dials and two antennaeâ\x80\x94a vertical one extending upwards from the right side and a horizontal loop antenna sticking out from the leftâ\x80\x94it looks like a gadget built for experiments rather than musical compositions. In fact, that was the original intention when it was designed as part of a Soviet research program in 1919. Despite being invented in a laboratory by a physicist-turned KGB spy, it was only a matter of time before the theremin made it big in Hollywood.', 'Electricity was just starting to transform daily life in the early 1900s. Prior to the 1920s, less than half of U.S. homes had electrical power. Recordings of songs played on the radio, but the instruments used to play them were strictly acoustic. Silent pictures were still the norm at moviehouses.', 'It was in this climate that Leon Theremin created what would become the worldâ\x80\x99s first mass-produced electronic instrument. Born Lev Sergeyevich Termen in St. Petersberg, Russia, in 1896, he was a tinkerer from a young age. By 7 he could take apart a watch and put it back together, and by 15 he had built his own astronomical observatory. In his early twenties, the budding physicist was recruited by the newly founded Physical Technical Institute in Petrograd. As a student at the institution, Theremin conducted research into proximity sensors for the Soviet government in the wake of the October Revolution in 1917. His goal was to build a device that used electromagnetic waves to measure the density of gases, and could thus detect incoming objects. In trying to create that instrument, he instead created one that produced a whining sound similar to the thinner strings of a violin. When he moved his hand close to the machine, the pitch lept higher, and it dropped when he pulled his hand away.Â\xa0', 'Theremin was an experienced cellist as well as a physicist, and immediately saw the musical potential of his accidental invention. The burgeoning Soviet government saw its value as well, though it lacked military applications. ', 'Vladimir Lenin invited Theremin to the Kremlin to demonstrate his instrumentâ\x80\x94then known as the etherophoneâ\x80\x94in 1922. By moving his right hand along the vertical antenna to control the pitch and his left hand along the horizontal one to adjust the volume, Theremin performed Camille Saint-SaÃ«nsâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cThe Swanâ\x80\x9d and other pieces for the Russian leader. Lenin was impressed enough to send him on a concert tour around the country.Â\xa0', 'The tour eventually extended to Western Europe. Theremin performed for Albert Einstein in Berlin in 1927, and the following year he brought the instrument to the United States, filling venues like Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House with its ethereal music. The Soviet Union presented the world tour as a chance to show off its mastery of electric technology, but that wasnâ\x80\x99t their only motive. Theremin was sent to the U.S. as a spy first and a musician second.Â\xa0His high status in his field granted him access to major American tech corporations like RCA, which signed a contract to manufacture his instrument for the mass market in 1929.Â\xa0', 'The company paid him $100,000 for the rights, but it would be a while before that investment paid off. The first commercial theremins cost $220â\x80\x94worth about $3700 today, and a prohibitively high price for many hobbyists. Because players controlled it by moving their hands through empty air, the learning curve was also steep. The Great Depression killed any hopes of it becoming an overnight sensation, and RCA suspended production.', 'The instrumentâ\x80\x99s inventor, meanwhile, was facing his own hardships. Despite the intelligence he gathered for his home country, Theremin wasnâ\x80\x99t welcomed as a hero upon his return. The Soviet Union was in the midst of Joseph Stalinâ\x80\x99s political purges, and in 1939, Theremin was arrested for alleged treason and sentenced to eight years in a Gulag for scientists, where he invented bugging devices and aircraft technology for the military. ', 'Thereminâ\x80\x99s days as a world-renowned concert performer were over, but the instrument that had adopted his namesake was just starting to take off on the other side of the globe.', 'The theremin made its cinematic debut roughly a decade after its invention. Dmitri Shostakovich became the first film composer to use it when he scored the 1930 Russian film Odna, or Alone. Instead of leaning into the instrumentâ\x80\x99s modern sound, he used it to evoke the howling Siberian winds the main character faces at the end of the movie.', 'In the 1940s, the unusual instrument was first featured in Hollywood film scores. Its association with sci-fi wasnâ\x80\x99t immediate. In this decade, it was more often utilized in thrillers and mysteries to add an unsettling effect to scenes where a character experienced psychological distress. In Alfred Hitchcockâ\x80\x99s 1945 movie Spellbound, composer MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa used the instrument to suggest mental instability when a white bathroom triggers the protagonistâ\x80\x99s repressed memories of a skiing accident. The same composer also included it in his score for Billy Wilderâ\x80\x99s The Lost Weekend, released that same year.Â\xa0', 'The theremin didnâ\x80\x99t find its true niche until the 1950s. The decade was characterized by advancements in space exploration and anxieties about nuclear warâ\x80\x94both of which helped fuel a golden age of science fiction in cinema. One of the earliest and most famous examples of the instrument in sci-fi is Bernard Herrmannâ\x80\x99s score for The Day the Earth Stood Still. ', 'In the 1951 movie, the electric squeal helped create a threatening and uncanny atmosphere around the alien invaders that couldnâ\x80\x99t be achieved through costumes and special effects alone; countless alien and monster flicks that followed would borrow this same musical trick. By the end of the 1950s, the American public no longer viewed the theremin as a Soviet curio; it had become the official sound of outer space.', 'Though its cultural impact peaked in the mid-20th century, the theremin saw a brief resurgence in the 1990s. This was largely thanks to Tim Burton; the instrument adds a retro, B-movie vibe to the scores for his movies Ed Wood (1994), composed by Howard Shore, and Mars Attacks! (1996), composed by Danny Elfman. In Joel Schumacherâ\x80\x99s Batman Forever (1995), Elliot Goldenthal used a theremin to compose the Riddlerâ\x80\x99s kooky mad scientist theme.Â\xa0', 'In each of these cases, the sound carried connotations it didnâ\x80\x99t have 40 years prior. Instead of inspiring sincere dread, the high-pitched tone calls to mind an antiquated vision of the future popularized by low-budget sci-fi movies. A theremin can add a layer of nostalgiaâ\x80\x94or even ironic cheesinessâ\x80\x94to modern media, but filmmakers canâ\x80\x99t use it the way Alfred Hitchcock did in the 1940s and expect viewers to take them seriously. ', 'More than a century after its invention, itâ\x80\x99s clear that the instrument will always be associated with the 1950s sci-fi boom, even if its origins as a tool for Soviet espionage are just as interesting and bizarre.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/theremin-history-hollywood-soviet-union

It was then that Lord Byron proposed that they have a competition to see who could come up with the best ghost story: Byron, Mary, Percy, or Byronâ\x80\x99s physician, John Polidori.', 'In the end, neither Byron nor Percy finished a ghost story, although Polidori later wrote The Vampyreâ\x80\x94which influences vampire stories to this dayâ\x80\x94based on Byronâ\x80\x99s offering. (Byronâ\x80\x99s piece was later published as â\x80\x9cA Fragment.â\x80\x9d)', 'At first, Mary had writerâ\x80\x99s block, and was unable to come up with a good idea for a ghost story. Then she had a waking dreamâ\x80\x94â\x80\x9cI did not sleep, nor could I be said to think,â\x80\x9d she said. In the introduction to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein [PDF], she described the vision as follows:', 'â\x80\x9cI saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life. â\x80¦ He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold, the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and looking on him with yellow, watery, but speculative eyes.â\x80\x9d', 'Mary opened her eyes and realized sheâ\x80\x99d found her story. â\x80\x9cWhat terrified me will terrify others,â\x80\x9d she thought. She began working on it the next day.', 'Plenty of real-life science inspired Shelley, including exploration of the North Pole and the then-mysterious causes of its magnetism and the work of chemist Sir Humphry Davy (whose lectures Shelley had attended with her father whens he was young). Another inspiration was the recently discovered phenomenon of galvanism, when muscles contract due to stimulation by electricity. â\x80\x9cPerhaps a corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things,â\x80\x9d Shelley mused later. â\x80\x9cPerhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.â\x80\x9d Shelley and company discussed galvanism while stuck inside in Switzerland, and those conversations contributed to Frankenstein.', 'Before she started Frankenstein, Shelley gave birth to a daughter, who died just days later. (In fact, only one of the Shelleysâ\x80\x99 four children lived to adulthood.) Soon after the baby died, she wrote in her journal, â\x80\x9cDream that my little baby came to life againâ\x80\x94that it had only been cold & that we rubbed it by the fire & it livedâ\x80\x94I awake & find no babyâ\x80\x94I think about the little thing all day.â\x80\x9d This circumstance, as well as the suicide of her half-sister Fanny, must have contributed to the novel.', 'In the novel, Victor Frankenstein is the scientist. The monster remains unnamed and is referred to as â\x80\x9cmonster,â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9ccreature,â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cdÃ¦mon,â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cit.â\x80\x9d But if youâ\x80\x99ve made the mistake of calling the monster â\x80\x9cFrankenstein,â\x80\x9d youâ\x80\x99re not alone. As early as 1890, The Scots Observer complained that Frankenstein â\x80\x9cpresented the common pressman with one of his most beloved blundersâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94confusing the two.', 'Mary made up the name Frankenstein. However, Frankenstein is a German name that means â\x80\x9cStone of the Franks.â\x80\x9d Whatâ\x80\x99s more, historian Radu Florescu claimed that the Shelleys visited Castle Frankenstein on a journey up the Rhine River. While there, they learned about an alchemist named Konrad Dippel who had lived in the castle. He was trying to create an elixir, called Dippelâ\x80\x99s Oil, which would make people live for over a hundred years. Like Victor Frankenstein, Dippel was rumored to have dug up graves and experimented on the bodies. Not all historians are convinced thereâ\x80\x99s a link, however, pointing out that thereâ\x80\x99s no indication Frankenstein had a castle in the novel, and that Shelley never mentioned visiting the castle herself in any of her writing about her trip up the Rhine.', 'Frankenstein was first published anonymously. It was dedicated to William Godwin, Maryâ\x80\x99s father, and Percy Shelley wrote the preface. Because of these connections, many assumed that Percy Shelley was the author. This myth continued even after Frankenstein was reprinted in Maryâ\x80\x99s name. In fact, some people are still arguing that Percy authored the bookâ\x80\x94but while he edited Frankenstein and encouraged Mary to expand the story into a novel, actual authorship is a stretch.', 'When Frankenstein came out in 1818, many critics bashed it. â\x80\x9cWhat a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity this work presents,â\x80\x9d John Croker, of the Quarterly Review, wrote. But Gothic novels were all the rage, and Frankenstein soon gained readers. In 1823, a play titled Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein cemented the storyâ\x80\x99s popularity. In 1831, a new version of the book was published, this time under Maryâ\x80\x99s name.', 'With Frankenstein, Shelley was writing the first major science fiction novel, as well as inventing the concept of the â\x80\x9cmad scientistâ\x80\x9d and helping establish what would become horror fiction. The influence of the book in popular culture is so huge that the term Frankenstein has entered common speech to mean something unnatural and horrendous.', 'Mary went on to write other science fiction, such as her short story Roger Dodsworth: The Reanimated Englishman, about a man who has been frozen in ice, and her novel The Last Man, about a survivor in a world destroyed by plague, from the same year.', 'In 1910, Thomas Edisonâ\x80\x99s studio made a one-reel, 15-minute film of Frankenstein, one of the first horror movies ever made.

NASAâ\x80\x99s long-standing public trust, which is essential for communicating findings about these phenomena to citizens, is crucial for destigmatizing UAP reporting. The scientific processes used by NASA encourage critical thinking; NASA can model for the public how to best approach the study of UAP, by utilizing transparent reporting, rigorous analysis, and public engagement.â\x80\x9d', 'Such phenomena has gained a lot of attention in recent months.

103,Why Do Goats Have Such Weird Eyes?,"['animals', 'big questions', 'science']","['Even with their yelling and fainting competing for your attention, itâ\x80\x99s hard not to notice a goatâ\x80\x99s eyes. Their horizontal, rectangular pupils seem alien compared to the round pupils of people and dogs and the vertical slits of cats. Why do goatsâ\x80\x99 eyes look like that? And for that matter, why do catsâ\x80\x99 eyes look the way they do? ', 'In a study published in 2015, vision scientist Martin Banks found that the shape of an animalâ\x80\x99s pupils is a clue to its place in the food chain.', 'Banks and his team looked at the eyes of 214 different species of land animals, and found a clear relationship between the shape of their pupils and their ecological role. Predatory animals that ambush their prey tend to have vertical slit pupils, while herbivores that are prey for other animals usually have horizontal pupils.', 'The predator-prey divide in pupil shape suggests that the hunters and the hunted gain some advantage from having a specific type of pupil. To find out what those advantages might be, the researchers analyzed the abilities of the two pupil shapes and how they could serve the different visual requirements of predators and prey.', 'Goats and other grazing animals (like deer, cattle, and moose) that are hunted by predators have a pretty simple strategy for not being eaten: look out for danger and run away if they see it. Their eyes need to be able to do two things to support that strategy. â\x80\x9cOn the one hand, these animals must see panoramically to detect predators that could approach from various directions,â\x80\x9d the researchers write. â\x80\x9cOn the other hand, they must see sufficiently clearly in the forward direction to guide rapid locomotion over potentially rough terrain.â\x80\x9d', 'Horizontal pupils help here, the team found, because their shape creates a sharp panoramic view thatâ\x80\x99s wider and shorter than what youâ\x80\x99d get with a round or vertical pupil and lets the animal see nearly all around itself. A long horizontal pupil also enhances the image quality of objects ahead of and behind the animal, and helps the eye capture more light along the ground and less dazzling overhead light.', 'Of course, those benefits donâ\x80\x99t apply if the pupil stays oriented the same way and becomes vertically aligned when the animal tilts its head to graze. After watching grazing animals at the zoo, though, the researchers found that their eyes rotate to stay horizontally aligned with the ground whether their heads are upright or face down in the grass.', 'For a land animal thatâ\x80\x99s in danger of being eaten by something else and has few options besides being aware of its surroundings and running away, the researchers say that a long horizontal pupil seems to be ideal. In other words, goats have weird eyes because they help keep goats alive.', 'Meanwhile, the team found that vertical, slit-shaped pupils help small ambush predators like cats and snakes judge the distance of prey and other objects so they know how far they have to pounce. Bigger cats and wolves, on the other hand, have round pupils because theyâ\x80\x99re taller and need to chase down a kill rather than pouncing on it.', 'Banks and his colleagues only studied land animals, but round, horizontal, and vertical are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to pupil shapes: There are w-shaped pupils, crescent-shaped pupils, heart-shaped pupils, and more.

The results, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, came after scientists turned off genes in pig embryos responsible for their own kidney development. Modified human stem cells were then introduced into roughly 1800 embryos, which were transferred to 13 surrogates. After 28 days, five embryos had grown kidneys that were up to 65 percent human cells.', 'â\x80\x9cIt took us five years,â\x80\x9d senior study author Miguel Esteban told CNN. â\x80\x9cWe modified the pig genetically to create a space for the human cells to grow with less competition from pig cells, and we also modified the human cells to make them survive in an environment that was not their natural one.â\x80\x9d', 'While the findings are promising, a number of obstacles remain. A kidney intended for a human cannot contain any pig cells; a human-pig hybrid kidney would be rejected by the human body and not be viable. There are also a variety of kidney cell types; the study worked with only two of them.', 'The advancement of such practices also present ethical quandaries.

Confidential press releases had gone out to journalists with the strict instruction not to leak the news before February 27.', 'But that night, the team was tipped off that journalist Robin McKie was going to break the story the very next day in the British newspaper The Observer.', 'Wilmut and Campbell raced to the lab at the Roslin Institute on Sunday morning as McKieâ\x80\x99s story hit the media like a thunderbolt. International news outlets had already started swarming at the institute for access to Wilmut and Campbellâ\x80\x99s creation: Dolly the sheep, the worldâ\x80\x99s first mammal successfully cloned from a single adult cell. Shielded from the general public, she stuck her nose through the fence and munched calmly on the hay in her pen, unperturbed by the horde of news photographers. Dolly, a woolly, bleating scientific miracle, looked much like other sheep, but with a remarkable genetic difference.', 'By the end of that Sunday, February 23, nearly every major newspaper in the world carried headlines about Dolly the sheep.', 'Born on July 5, 1996, Dolly was cloned by Wilmut and Campbellâ\x80\x99s team at the Roslin Institute, a part of the University of Edinburgh, and Scottish biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics. The scientists cloned Dolly by inserting DNA from a single sheep mammary gland cell into an egg of another sheep, and then implanting it into a surrogate mother sheep. Dolly thus had three mothersâ\x80\x94one that provided the DNA from the cell, the second that provided the egg, and the third that carried the cloned embryo to term. Technically, though, Dolly was an exact genetic replica of only the sheep from which the cell was taken.', 'Following the announcement, the Roslin Institute received 3000 phone calls from around the world. Dollyâ\x80\x99s birth was heralded as one of the most important scientific advances of the decade.', 'But Dolly wasnâ\x80\x99t scienceâ\x80\x99s first attempt at cloning. Researchers had been exploring the intricacies of cloning for almost a century. In 1902, German embryologists Hans Spemann and Hilda Mangold, his student, successfully grew two salamanders from a single embryo split with a noose made up of a strand of hair. Since then, cloning experiments continued to become more sophisticated and nuanced. Several laboratory animal clones, including frogs and cows, were created before Dolly. But all of them had been cloned from embryos. Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from a specialized adult cell.', 'Embryonic stem cells, which form right after fertilization, can turn into any kind of cell in the body. After they modify into specific types of cells, like neurons or blood cells, theyâ\x80\x99re call specialized cells. Since the cell that gave rise to Dolly was already specialized for its role as a mammary gland cell, most scientists thought it would be impossible to clone anything from it but other mammary gland cells. Dolly proved them wrong.', 'Many scientists in the â\x80\x9990s were flabbergasted. Dollyâ\x80\x99s advent showed that specialized cells could be used to create an exact replica of the animal they came from. â\x80\x9cIt means all science fiction is true,â\x80\x9d biology professor Lee Silver of Princeton University told The New York Times in 1997.', 'The Washington Post reported that â\x80\x9cDolly, depending on which commentator you read, is the biggest story of the year, the decade, even the century. Wilmut has seen himself compared with Galileo, with Copernicus, with Einstein, and at least once with Dr. Frankenstein.â\x80\x9d', 'Scientists, lawmakers, and the public quickly imagined a future shaped by unethical human cloning. President Bill Clinton called for review of the bioethics of cloning and proposed legislation that would ban cloning meant â\x80\x9cfor the purposes of creating a childâ\x80\x9d (it didnâ\x80\x99t pass). The World Health Organization concluded that human cloning was â\x80\x9cethically unacceptable and contrary to human integrity and moralityâ\x80\x9d [PDF].

That would have confirmed whether Dolly was the daughter of the sheep that gave birth to her. In The New York Times, Zinder called the Scottish pairâ\x80\x99s work â\x80\x9cjust lousy science, incomplete science.â\x80\x9d But NIH director Harold Varmus toldÂ\xa0the Times that he had no doubt that Dolly was a clone of an adult sheep.', 'Because she was cloned from a mammary gland cell, Dolly was namedâ\x80\x94dad joke alertâ\x80\x94after buxom country music superstar Dolly Parton. (Parton didnâ\x80\x99t mind the attribution.) Like her namesake, Dolly the sheep was a bona fide celebrity: She posed for magazines, including People; became the subject of books, journal articles, and editorials; had an opera written about her; starred in commercials; and served as a metaphor in an electoral campaign.', 'And that wasnâ\x80\x99t all: New York Times reporter Gina Kolata, one of the first journalists to give readers an in-depth look at Dolly, wroteÂ\xa0Clone: The Road to Dolly, and the Path Ahead and contrasted the animalâ\x80\x99s creation with the archetypes in Frankenstein and The Island of Dr. Moreau. American composer Steve Reich was so affected by Dollyâ\x80\x99s story that he featured it in Three Tales, a video-opera exploring the dangers of technology.', 'The sheep also became an inadvertent political player when the Scottish National Party used her image on posters to suggest that candidates of other parties were all clones of one another. Appliance manufacturer Zanussi used her likeness for a poster with her name and the provocative caption â\x80\x9cThe Misappliance of Scienceâ\x80\x9d (the poster was later withdrawn after scientists complained). In fact, so widespread was the (mis)use of her name that her makers eventually trademarked it to stop the practice.', 'Following Dolly, many larger mammals were cloned, including horses and bulls. Roslin Biomed, set up by the Roslin Institute to focus on cloning technology, was later sold to the U.S.-based Geron Corporation, which combined cloning technology with stem cell research. But despite her popularityâ\x80\x94and widespread fearâ\x80\x94Â\xa0Dollyâ\x80\x99s birth didnâ\x80\x99t lead to an explosion in cloning: Human cloning was deemed too dangerous and unethical, while animal cloning was only minimally useful for agricultural purposes. The sheepâ\x80\x99sÂ\xa0real legacy is considered to be the advancement in stem cell research.', 'Dollyâ\x80\x99s existence showed it was possible to change one cellâ\x80\x99s gene expression by swapping its nucleus for another. Stem cell biologist Shinya Yamanaka told Scientific American that Dollyâ\x80\x99s cloning motivated him to successfully develop stem cells from adult cells. He later won a Nobel Prize for his results, called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) because theyâ\x80\x99re artificially created and can have a variety of uses. They reduced the need for embryonic stem cells in research, and today, iPS cells form the basis for most stem cell research and therapies, including regenerative medicine.', 'Dolly had sixÂ\xa0offspring, and led a productive, sociable life with many human fans coming to visit her. In 2003, a veterinary examination showed that Dolly had a progressive lung disease, and she was put down. But four clonesÂ\xa0created from the same cell line in 2007 faced no such health issues and aged normally.', 'Dolly is still a spectacle, though, nearly 25 years after her creation: Her body was taxidermied and putÂ\xa0on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.', 'A version of this article was published in 2020; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/626810/dolly-the-sheep-media-sensation
106,8 Mind-Blowing Facts About the Big Bang,"['physics', 'space', 'science']","['As far as theoretical physics go, the Big Bang theory is one of the more concrete concepts out there. Although we still donâ\x80\x99t quite understand what caused the Big Bang itself, evidence of its occurrence is so strong that itâ\x80\x99s developed from a theory into an established fact. Speaking of facts, here are eight interesting things you might not know about the birth of the universe.', 'Perhaps surprisingly, the first person to put the Big Bang theory into words was a Belgian Catholic priest. Well, a priest who was also an acclaimed mathematician and astronomer. Georges LeMaÃ®tre came up with the idea in 1927 while studying at MIT. Observing that galaxies were moving away from each other, LeMaÃ®tre supposed they must have been closer to each other in the pastâ\x80\x94so close that, at one point in time, they might have been compressed to the size of a â\x80\x9cprimeval atom,â\x80\x9d the pressure of which generated an explosion of unimaginable proportions.Â\xa0', 'Although LeMaÃ®tre came up with the theory of the Big Bang, he was not the one to coin its iconic name. That honor goes to Sir Fred Hoyle, an English astronomer belonging to an enclave of scholars who insisted that the universe was neither expanding nor contracting, but stational. He first used the term during a BBC radio broadcast in 1949, which he attended to refute the eventâ\x80\x99s existence.', 'If the existence of the Big Bang could be inferred from the growing distance between galaxies, so could the point in time that it happened. Using the redshiftâ\x80\x94the changing wavelength of cosmic lightâ\x80\x94LeMaÃ®tre and astronomer Edwin Hubble, the namesake of the Hubble Space Telescope, could determine a galaxyâ\x80\x99s velocity and speed. Hubble, using faulty calculations, estimated the universe to be only around 2 billion years old [PDF].', 'Future generations of scientists corrected the tiny mistakes in Hubbleâ\x80\x99s math, revealing that the universe was far older than previously believed, with the Big Bang happening at least 13.8 billion years ago. Even that number isnâ\x80\x99t certain, though. In 2023, the discovery of â\x80\x9csuper-oldâ\x80\x9d stars on the fringes of the cosmos led a researchers from the University of Ottawa to propose that the Big Bang could have happened as far back as 26.7 billion years ago.', 'Though based on solid observations, the Big Bang theory was dismissed for decades before it became commonly accepted. Among the disbelievers was Albert Einstein, who rejected the theory when it was pushed first by LeMaÃ®tre and later by a Soviet physicist named Alexander Friedmann. Einsteinâ\x80\x99s theory of general relativity had been the most groundbreaking development since Isaac Newton, and while it explained many mysterious cosmic phenomena, the Big Bang was not one of them.', 'This is because, according to general relativity, the universe is supposed to be static, unmoving. If galaxies arenâ\x80\x99t moving apart in the future, they werenâ\x80\x99t closer together in the past, making the Big Bang inconceivable. This explains Einsteinâ\x80\x99s emphatic reaction to LeMaÃ®tre: â\x80\x9cYour calculations are correct, but your physics is abominable!â\x80\x9d Even after the Big Bang became widely accepted, Einstein   briefly revisited the theory of a static universe, according to a manuscript found after his death.', 'Debate over whether the universe was moving or not came to an end when, in 1965, lab physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered direct evidence of the Big Bang in the form of radio waves refurbishing throughout the cosmos. These waves, called the Cosmic Microwave Background, are the cooled-off remains of the light of the Big Bang itself.', 'Believe it or not, youâ\x80\x99ve seen the Cosmic Microwave Background with your own eyes. And youâ\x80\x99ve likely seen it more than once, because the CMB produces the static signal (a.k.a. â\x80\x9csnowâ\x80\x9d) you see on analog TVs and hear on radios when you search between stations.Â\xa0', 'Contemporary scholarship doubts that the universe was once constricted to the single atom that LeMaÃ®tre talked about. It has, however, been estimated to have covered an area smaller than the size of a pinhead. Although itâ\x80\x99s almost obvious that the Big Bang was the most powerful explosion of all time, its approximate strength remains difficult to fully wrap your head around. According to Universe Magazine, the force released during the Big Bang equaled 1054 megatons of TNT. To put that into perspective, hydrogens bombs, the most destructive weapons humans can create, release around 50 megatons.', 'The Big Bang also happened fast. So fast that energy was thrown at the speed of lightâ\x80\x94300 million meters per second, a million times greater than hydrogen bombs. All this unfathomable speed and power produced an equally unfathomable amount of heat. It has been estimated that, in a fraction of a second past the detonation, temperatures could have risen to as high as 1000 trillion degrees Celsius.', 'The biggest challenge to the Big Bang theory in decades emerged shortly after the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. The most powerful telescope in existence, it allows scientists to study parts of the universe that were previously unobservable. Searching the edge of the known universe, it discovered galaxies that were so large and so old, our current understanding of galactic formation and evolution fails to explain how they could have been created so shortly after the Big Bang.', 'The discovery presented two options: either the Big Bang theory was wrong, or the measurements taken from the James Webb Space Telescope were incorrect. The second one proved to be the case. Using more precise and reliable methods to determine the distance of the galaxies, NASA concluded that they were much smaller in size than they originally appearedâ\x80\x94small enough for artificial intelligence to simulate their construction following the Big Bang.Â\xa0', 'If winding back the clock on cosmic expansion brings us to the beginning of the universe, winding the same clock forward could take us to its end. Several theories have been proposed for the death of the universe, many of which are mirror images to the Big Bang.', 'One of these theories is the Big Freeze, which supposes the universe will â\x80\x9cdieâ\x80\x9d when the distance between celestial objects has become so great that energy becomes evenly distributed and space approaches absolute zero temperature. Another possibility is the Big Crunch, which supposes the universe, stretched to its maximum, will one day cease to expand and start contracting, eventually recreating the conditions for another Big Bang. A third scenario called Eternal Inflation posits that expansion is a never-ending process that only stops in certain points of the universe, leading to the creation of self-contained pocket universes like the one we live in.', 'In his 2010 book Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Roger Penrose proposed that galactic formation was a cyclical (as opposed to linear) process, and that the Big Bangâ\x80\x94far from marking the birth of everything in existenceâ\x80\x94is actually a transition between the end of an old universe and the start of a new one.', 'However, most efforts to imagine what happened before the Big Bang are poorly received in academic circles. As astrophysicist Ethan Siegel wrote for Big Think in 2023, there currently is no â\x80\x9cevidence of a universe before the Big Bang.â\x80\x9d If our universe arose from a previous one, through Eternal Inflation or otherwise, traces of that previous universe should show up in ours, in the structures of our galaxies and in the CMB. But they donâ\x80\x99t, meaning that the Big Bang, as far as we can tell, was indeed the beginning of the beginning.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/big-bang-facts
107,Why Do Microwave Oven Doors Have Mesh Grating?,"['news', 'science', 'technology', 'mf explains it all']","['No matter how often you use it, your microwave may inspire confusion. Itâ\x80\x99s probably the only appliance in your kitchen that turns aluminum foil into pyrotechnics, and that can produce food thatâ\x80\x99s both half-frozen and hot enough to leave scars. Even the design may have you scratching your head as you heat up your leftovers. If youâ\x80\x99ve ever questioned the mesh pattern that appears on microwave doors, you should know itâ\x80\x99s there for a good reason.', 'As Science Friday explains, the dark grating is there for your protection. Microwave ovens use electromagnetic radiation to heat food. Microwaves (as in the actual waves, not the appliance) are long compared to other forms of radiation like X-rays or gamma rays. Theyâ\x80\x99re about 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) long, making them bigger than wavelengths of visible light.Â\xa0', 'The mesh of microwave oven doors is designed with this in mind. Microwaves canâ\x80\x99t fit through the pin-prick holes, so they bounce off the door and back into the box. Light waves are small enough to penetrate the holes, which allows you to watch your food as itâ\x80\x99s being cooked without exposing yourself to radiation.Â\xa0', 'This structure is called a Faraday cage (named after scientist Michael Faraday), and it does more than keep you safeâ\x80\x94it allows the appliance to work properly. Microwaves heat food by frantically bouncing against the walls of the oven, including the mesh window. The randomness of the heat source is the reason your meal can come out scaldingly hot in some spots and cold in others.Â\xa0', 'Even if you donâ\x80\x99t love the idea of a thin grate separating you from radiation exposure, you shouldnâ\x80\x99t necessarily ditch your microwave. While theyâ\x80\x99re not something you want to absorb on a daily basis, microwaves pose a relatively minor threat compared to other forms of radiation. Because theyâ\x80\x99re longer, microwaves give off non-ionizing radiation, so they donâ\x80\x99t inflict damage on a molecular level the way X-rays can. So even if small amounts of radiation do manage to escape your microwave oven, thereâ\x80\x99s no need to don protective gear before checking on your Hot Pocket.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/mesh-grate-microwave-purpose

110,10 Facts About the Portuguese Man O' War,"['lists', 'science', 'animals', 'oceans']","['The dangerous Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war, which has a potentially deadly sting, is often sighted on U.S. beachesâ\x80\x94which leads to problems for beachgoers. Read on to learn more about these unusual creatures.', 'The Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war may look like a bloated jellyfish, but itâ\x80\x99s actually a siphonophoreâ\x80\x94a bizarre group of animals that consist of colonies made up of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of genetically identical individual creatures. A siphonophore starts out as a fertilized egg. But as it develops, it starts â\x80\x9cbuddingâ\x80\x9d into distinct structures and organisms. These tiny organisms, called polyps or zooids, canâ\x80\x99t survive on their own, so they merge together into a tentacled mass. They must cooperate as one in order to do things like travel and catch food.', 'Though the zooids within a man oâ\x80\x99 war are basically clones, they come in different shapes and serve different purposes [PDF]. Dactylozooids are long hunting tentacles built to ensnare prey; gastrozooids are smaller tentacles which digest the food; and gonozooids are dangling entities whose job is to facilitate reproduction. Every man oâ\x80\x99 war also has a pneumatophore, or â\x80\x9cfloatâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94an overgrown, bag-like polyp which acts as a giant gas bladder and sits at the top of the colony. Capable of expanding or contracting at will, it provides the man oâ\x80\x99 war with some buoyancy control. An expanded float also enables the colony to harness winds to move around.', 'When we say Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war, weâ\x80\x99re talking about Physalia physalis, the siphonophore also known as the Atlantic Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war, which can be found in warmer parts of Pacific, Caribbean, Indian, and Atlantic waters.', 'Another kind of siphonophore that regularly stings beachgoers is the bluebottle, Physalia utriculus. Itâ\x80\x99s sometimes called the Indo-Pacific Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war and is restricted to the Pacific and Indian oceans. Itâ\x80\x99s smaller than the Atlantic species and, unlike its bigger counterpart, it hunts with a single, elongated tentacle.', 'In the Age of Sail, many European navies used tall warships loaded with cannons and propelled by the wind. British sailors took to calling this kind of vessel a â\x80\x9cman of war.â\x80\x9d', 'Physalia physalias colonies spend a lot of time floating at the waterâ\x80\x99s surface, and when the gas bladder is expanded, it looks and acts a bit like a sailboat, hence the man oâ\x80\x99 war moniker. As for the Portuguese part, 19th-century scientists proposed that sailors encountered it near the Portuguese island of Madeira, while modern etymologists tend to think that it looked like the Portuguese version of the ship. Itâ\x80\x99s also been suggested that Renaissance-era sailors thought the pneumatophores resembled the helmets worn by Portugalâ\x80\x99s soldiers during the 16th century.', 'Thatâ\x80\x99s the maximum length for the dactylozooidsâ\x80\x94which are normally around 30 feet long and use venom-spewing cells to deliver painful, neurotoxic stings. When a tentacle is detached from the rest of the colony, it might wash ashore somewhere or drift around for days on end until it decomposes. Even a severed tentacle can sting you.', 'The odds of being killed by a Portuguese man oâ\x80\x99 war are slim. But just because deaths are rare doesnâ\x80\x99t mean you should touch one. In 2018, 204 people in Hollywood, Florida, were treated for stings, which can lead to red welts on the skin, muscle cramps, elevated heart rates, and vomiting.', 'In 1987, one victim suffered a cardiovascular collapse and died after getting too close to a man oâ\x80\x99 war in eastern Florida. A woman swimming off Sardinia was stung by one and died of what was believed to be anaphylactic shock in 2010.', 'Given that tiny fish make up about 70 to 90 percent of the man oâ\x80\x99 warâ\x80\x99s diet (it also eats shrimp and other crustaceans), Nomeus gronovii, a.k.a. the man oâ\x80\x99 war fish, is playing a dangerous game: It lives among the siphonophoreâ\x80\x99s tentacles even though itâ\x80\x99s not immune to its stings, swimming nimbly between the stingers. Young fish eat plankton that wanders under their hosts and, as they get older, will sometimes steal the man oâ\x80\x99 warâ\x80\x99s preyâ\x80\x94or nibble on its tentacles.', 'The man oâ\x80\x99 war has a long list of enemies. Loggerhead sea turtles and the ocean sunfish eat them. There are also blue dragon sea slugs, which not only devour the man oâ\x80\x99 war but actively harvest and appropriate its toxins. After storing man oâ\x80\x99 war stinging cells in their own skins, the blue dragons can use it as a predator deterrent.', 'Although itâ\x80\x99s translucent, the float is usually tinted with blue, pink, and/or purple hues [PDF]. Beaches along the American Gulf Coast raise purple flags in order to let visitors know when groups of man oâ\x80\x99 war (or other potentially deadly sea creatures) are at large.', 'The man oâ\x80\x99 warâ\x80\x99s gonozooids have sacs that house ovaries or testesâ\x80\x94so each colony can therefore be considered male or female. Though marine biologists arenâ\x80\x99t completely sure how the man oâ\x80\x99 war procreates, one theory is that the gonozooids release eggs and sperm into the open ocean, which become fertilized when they cross paths with floating eggs or sperm from other man oâ\x80\x99 war colonies. This method of reproduction, called broadcast spawning, is also used by many species of coral, fan worms, sea anemones, and jellyfish.', ""The man oâ\x80\x99 war isn't always seen in isolation. Legions consisting of over 1000 colonies have been observed floating around together.

111,When Scientists Discovered a New Accent Forming in Antarctica,"['language', 'science', 'antarctica', 'news']","['Imagine being stranded in the icy wilderness of Antarctica, cut off from the rest of the world, with only a small group of people for company. Such a group might be expected to develop a culture of its own, but would that extend to the development of a new shared accent? It sounds like something out of a science fiction novel, but as IFL Science reports, linguists studied just such a situation and reported on their findings in the 2019 study â\x80\x9cPhonetic change in an Antarctic winter,â\x80\x9d published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America .', 'Given that adults typically have great difficulty with pronunciation when learning a new language, it stands to reason that after a certain age, our accents would be set. But that turns out not to be the case.', 'As part of an ongoing project to explain the forces â\x80\x9cthat shape spoken accent development ultimately leading to language diversification and change,â\x80\x9d a group of researchers headed by Jonathan Harrington, professor of phonetics and speech processing at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, embarked on the study. They recruited 11 participants from the British Antarctic Survey who were part of the small team that overwinters on the continent. Eight of the participants were British speakers of English (five were from south or southeast England, while three were from the north/northwest), but the group also included an American, a person whose first language was German, and a person whose first language was Icelandic.', 'The linguists recorded the speech patterns of the participantsâ\x80\x94who were asked to read selected wordsâ\x80\x94at regular intervals and compared them to control recordings taken in the United Kingdom before deployment.', 'The findings revealed subtle but measurable changes in the speech of the overwintering staff during their time in Antarctica. One change was convergence, where individuals in a close-knit group unconsciously begin to adopt similar speech characteristics. In this case, that meant convergence of /u/ (the â\x80\x9cooâ\x80\x9d in goose), /ju/ (the â\x80\x9cyouâ\x80\x9d in few), /ou/ (the â\x80\x9cohâ\x80\x9d in goat), and /Éª:/ (the â\x80\x9ceeâ\x80\x9d in the last syllable in happy). ', 'But another was a very slight change in the pronunciation of the /ou/ sound, as in goat: The over-winterers began to pronounce it more toward the front of their mouths than toward the back. (British pronunciations are already typically fronter than American /ou/.) This finding shows that the new accent isnâ\x80\x99t just an average of the starting accents. That said, the presence of two outliers, the German speaker and the American speaker, strongly influenced the results, so the researchers cautionedÂ\xa0â\x80\x9cagainst extrapolating general conclusions from this small and indeed skewed sample of speakers.â\x80\x9d', 'â\x80\x9cThe Antarctic accent is not really perceptible as suchâ\x80\x94it would take much longer for it to become soâ\x80\x94but it is acoustically measurable,â\x80\x9d Harrington told IFLScience. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s far more embryonic [than conventional English accents] given that it had only a short time to develop and also, of course, because itâ\x80\x99s only distributed across a small group of speakers.â\x80\x9d Still, the study demonstrates that adults can develop a shared accent in a relatively short time, challenging assumptions that adult accents are relatively fixed.', 'The linguists also did more than observe: They created a model based on the pre-arrival recordings, which successfully predicted some specific changes they later observed. â\x80\x9cThe individuals were found to develop the first stages of a common accent in Antarctica whose phonetic characteristics were in some respects predicted by the computational model,â\x80\x9d the study notes.', 'Additional pronunciations have since been added to the computational model, which could be used to analyze how migration and accent exposure alter language sounds, to study past environmental impacts on language, or to predict future changes. According to Harrington, â\x80\x9cThe most important use will be in predicting the changes to speech sounds that take place when two dialects come into contact with each other or when one speaker migrates to a new dialect area.â\x80\x9d ', '[h/t IFLScience]', 'Are you a logophile?

Cyclone is a broad term for a large storm system that rotates around a center of low atmospheric pressure (a.k.a the eye of the storm). These air masses produce rain, wind, and lightning. Storms that originate over tropical or subtropical waters are called tropical cyclones, and they are some of the strongest storms on Earth. When warm, moist air rises off the oceanâ\x80\x99s surface, it leaves behind an area of low pressure. The surrounding air that fills the space eventually warms up as well. This humid air forms clouds, and as the cycle continues, the clouds swirl into a massive spiral fueled by the warm waters below.', 'Tropical cyclones with winds below 38 mph are officially called tropical depressions. When gusts range between 39 and 73 mph, they become tropical storms. The strongest tropical cyclones produce winds exceeding 74 mph, and this is where the naming gets complicated.', 'Hurricane is a regional name for a severe tropical cyclone that comes from the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, or eastern North Pacific oceans. So if you hear of a tropical storm producing 74 mph-plus winds over North America or Central America, itâ\x80\x99s a hurricane. Florida, Mexico, Hawaii, and the Caribbean islands are a few places where hurricanes can make landfall.', 'Hurricanes are categorized according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which was developed by structural engineer Herbert Saffir and National Hurricane Center (NHC) director Robert Simpson in the late 1960s and early â\x80\x9870s. A Category 1 storm is the weakest type of hurricane, with wind speeds ranging from 74 to 95 mph. The scale goes up to Category 5, which describes storms with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher.', 'The NHC and World Meteorological Association use a naming system to keep track of the hurricanes that form each season. They use six lists of 21 names, which they cycle through every six years. The names of particularly strong and destructive storms are usually retired from the system.', 'Meteorologically speaking, typhoons are identical to hurricanesâ\x80\x94the biggest difference lies in where they happen. Typhoon is the name given to tropical cyclones with sustained wind speeds over 74 mph that form over the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Typhoons have the potential to be stronger than hurricanes because they form over warmer water, and they impact East Asian countries like Taiwan, Japan, China, and the Philippines. Though they can also be measured using the Saffir-Simpson scale, they generally fall into two categories: typhoons, with sustained winds between 74 and 149 mph, and super typhoons, with winds exceeding 150 mph.', 'Like hurricanes, typhoons have their own naming system. The Japanese Meteorological Agency assigns the names, and instead of switching to a new list at the beginning of a new year, they go straight through one big list over several seasons.', 'Even when viewed from space, typhoons and hurricanes are indistinguishable. Both form in the Northern Hemisphere, which means they spin counterclockwise. Tropical storms that occur south of the equator swirl clockwise, and when they hit southern countries like Australia, theyâ\x80\x99re simply called cyclones.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/649283/difference-between-hurricanes-cyclones-typhoons

116,Killer Lakes: Why Limnic Eruptions May Be the Worldâs Rarest Natural Disasters,"['How on Earth', 'geology', 'science']","['On August 21, 1986, a man making his way to Nyos, a village near a crater lake in northwest Cameroon, found dozens of dead animals along the road. He called into a home to see if the residents knew what had happened. Instead of getting answers, the man discovered that everyone in the village was dead, though they seemed otherwise unharmed.', 'Within days, officials confirmed that more than 1700 people in Nyos had died, along with several thousand animals. Local authorities were unsure what caused the disaster. But the strange and tragic event seemed similar to one that occurred two years earlier, just 60 miles to the south.', 'At Lake Monoun, on August 15, 1984, villagers found 37 people and many animals dead along its shores. Initially, authorities were baffled about the cause and even suspected domestic terrorism. They interviewed witnesses who reported hearing rumbling sounds and seeing a sudden rise of a strange white cloud from the lake, which quickly dissipated.', 'The Lake Monoun tragedy had puzzled geologists and local officials, but the disaster at Lake Nyos caught the worldâ\x80\x99s attention. Scientists from around the globe gathered in Nyos to investigate. Because Lake Nyos sits on a dormant volcano, their first theory was that the volcano had erupted and sent poisonous gases into the air. After further research, they found the cause was much more unusual.', 'The deadly events at Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos were both extremely rare natural disasters called limnic eruptions.', 'The two events in Cameroon are the only recorded instances of limnic eruptions. Although deadly and objectively terrifying, limnic eruptions are extremely unlikely because they require a specific combination of factors to occurâ\x80\x94factors that happened to be found at Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos in the 1980s.', 'Also called lake overturn, a limnic eruption occurs when dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from the deep waters of a lake, forming a deadly gas cloud above the surface. Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, the cloud will sink toward the ground, suffocating wildlife, livestock, and humans.', 'Limnic eruptions occur in places where there is a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the water. The CO2 can be created by various geological processes, but the most common source is volcanic gases from Earthâ\x80\x99s magma that have moved upward.', ""Carbon dioxide can dissolve more easily in areas with high pressure, such as the deep, cold parts of lakes. As a result, the bottom of deep lakes can have very high levels of carbon dioxide, while the levels decrease towards the lake's surface. Limnic eruptions are only likely to occur in stratified lakes, which means that the water stays in layers that rarely mix, keeping the CO2 stuck at the bottom while the pressure builds and builds."", ""Any changes in temperature or pressure can trigger the rapid and forceful release of the accumulated carbon dioxide from the lake's water, causing an eruption. It is unclear what triggered Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos to explode, but considering both lakesâ\x80\x99 proximity to the Oku Volcanic Field, it is possible that an earthquake or small volcanic eruption occurred before each disaster. We may never know exactly what caused them."", 'After studying the chemical composition and geology around Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, experts concluded that the eruptions were made possible by carbon dioxide building up in the cold waters at the bottom of the lakes, pressure increasing, and gases eventually exploding like a can of shaken-up seltzer. Researchersâ\x80\x99 attention turned to identifying other lakes with the right ingredients for limnic eruptions and preventing the disasters from happening, focusing on Lake Kivu on the border of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Lake Kivu, just south of the very active Nyiragongo stratovolcano, contains high amounts of carbon dioxide that doesnâ\x80\x99t dissipate at the surface. These factors put the lake at risk for a limnic eruption in the future. But scientists have an advantage now, thanks to research conducted after the Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos eruptions.', 'Starting in 1992 at Lake Monoun and in 1995 at Lake Nyos, researchers began experimenting with degassing methods, a process that involves installing a pipe into the CO2-rich layers of the lake and allowing the water to jet out like a fountain at the surface, harmlessly dissipating the gas [PDF]. For testing, they used special tubes with sensors and control valves anchored on a floating raft in each of the lakes. This setup allowed experts to monitor the slow and safe release and avoid an explosion.', ""They started full-scale degassing in 2001 at Lake Nyos and in 2003 at Lake Monoun. Another pipe was installed at each lake a few years later, and the efforts successfully reduced the bodies' CO2 levels, making devastating explosions less likely in the future."", 'Scientists now have a better understanding of how potentially lethal amounts of gas accumulate in lakes and the likelihood for catastrophic limnic eruptions. Lakes Monoun and Nyos still serve as natural laboratories for developing new investigation methods and equipment to watch forâ\x80\x94and preventâ\x80\x94similar disasters.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/limnic-eruptions-volcanic-lakes

118,13 Facts About Ãtzi the Iceman,"['archaeology', 'history', 'lists', 'science']","['When hikers in the Ã\x96tztal Alps stumbled on a body melting out of a glacier in September 1991, they thought they had found an unfortunate mountaineer who had disappeared perhaps a couple decades prior. But as soon as it was revealed that the mummified remains dated back 5300 yearsâ\x80\x94and that the man had been murdered by an arrow to the backâ\x80\x94researchers knew they had to solve the most fascinating ancient forensic case ever found. Nicknamed Ã\x96tzi, the Iceman, and Frozen Fritz, the body of a man who was around 40 or 50 years old when he died in the Copper Age continues to generate new data about a past era and shows links to contemporary people. Here are 13 surprising facts about Ã\x96tzi.', 'Ã\x96tzi might very well be the oldest person ever subject to a custody dispute. He was discovered in a part of the Alps mountain range that is right on the border between Austria and Italy. Complicating the find is the fact that the glacier in which he was entombed for millennia has shrunk since the official country border was established in 1919. This means that, although the find site of the mummy drains into Austria, the place Ã\x96tzi was actually resting is about 100 meters into Italian territory. Originally, Ã\x96tzi was studied at Innsbruck University in Austria, but since 1998 he has been displayed and studied at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy.', 'In 1991, an upright, carved stone was found in the town of Laces, near the Ã\x96tztal Alps where the Iceman was discovered. Although the stone was reused in modern times for the altar of a church, it dates to the Copper Age, just like Ã\x96tzi. One of the carvings on it depicts an archer shooting an arrow into the back of an unarmed manâ\x80\x94which bears striking similarities to how scientists know Ã\x96tzi died. This circumstantial evidence, though, has not convinced most researchers.', 'Even though Ã\x96tzi was comparatively old when he died, he was not exactly healthy. Whipworm parasite eggs were found in his gut contents, so he probably suffered from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His body also produced a full genome of H. pylori, a common stomach bug responsible for ulcers and other tummy troubles. There is also evidence that he had ingested a medicinal herb called hop hornbeam shortly before his death, possibly to help his indigestion. And one fingernail was found to have Beauâ\x80\x99s lines, which can be created when the immune system is compromised. Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s fingernail shows he was ill several times in the four months prior to death.', 'Since Ã\x96tzi died while going about his daily life, the artifacts found with him give us a snapshot in time. Two particularly curious objects were spheres of botanical material about the size of walnuts that were strung on leather straps. Analysis of the masses indicated they were a fungus called Piptoporus betulinus. Notably, this fungusâ\x80\x94if eatenâ\x80\x94both causes diarrhea and can protect against certain mycobacteria. It is likely that Ã\x96tzi was ingesting this fungus in an attempt to treat his whipwormâ\x80\x94the diarrheal action would have helped him get rid of the parasiteâ\x80\x99s eggs, while the antibiotic properties of the fungus would have killed off other intestinal bugs. Fungi like this were used for medicinal purposes until the 20th century.', 'The mummy boasts 61 different tattoos, and they are the oldest physical evidence of tattooing in the world. While the Iceman doesnâ\x80\x99t have â\x80\x9cMOMâ\x80\x9d on his biceps or a butterfly on his lower back, his tattoos are still quite interesting. They were made by scratching his skin and rubbing charcoal in the fresh wound, resulting in groups of lines or crosses. It has also been suggested that their placement over joints may have been an attempt to treat pain. As the oldest tattooed person ever found, Ã\x96tzi holds a Guinness World Record.', 'Long before Dolce & Gabbana dressed dapper Italian men, Ã\x96tzi was mixing materials to create his clothing. A 2016 study revealed the variety of species used to make Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s outfit. He wore a sheepskin loincloth, goat hide leggings and coat, and a hat made of the skin of a brown bear. Even his accessories were diverse: His shoelaces came from wild cows and his quiver from roe deer.', 'Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s field kit held a surprising number of different tools. There was a copper-bladed axe, which marks him as high status; a flint dagger and its tree-fiber sheath; and a bow made out of a yew tree. His quiver, fashioned out of deer hide with hazel wood supports, contained two finished arrows and a dozen unfinished shafts. He had a net for catching rabbits and birds, as well as a marble disc with a hole in the middle for hanging or carrying dead fowls. He also carried cylindrical containers made of birch bark, which kept charcoal embers hot for hours so he could quickly make a fire. His teeth were worn particularly on the left side, meaning he may have used his mouth to help work leather. The Icemanâ\x80\x99s hair also revealed high levels of arsenic, suggesting he was a pro at smelting ores to make copper.', 'Ã\x96tzi was short and stocky, around 5 feet 2 inches tall and 135 pounds, with strong legs. Visible injuries suggest he engaged in combat: Several right-sided rib fractures had healed, while Ã\x96tzi was struck in the head shortly before his death. A protein analysis of his brain reveals some healing, particularly in the form of blood clotsâ\x80\x94but those could have caused a stroke or embolism. The Iceman also suffered a long, deep stab wound to his right hand. Based on the stage of healing evident from the wound tissue, it occurred three to eight days before his death. And of course, the arrow lodged in his left shoulder was likely the ultimate cause of death. In short, Ã\x96tzi was a hunter and a fighter.', 'The materials in the Icemanâ\x80\x99s stomach revealed both his last meal and the meal before that. A 2018 study published in Current Biology tested Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s stomach contents and found traces of his final meal: dried ibex meat and fat, red deer meat, einkorn wheat, and remnants of a toxic plant. In the early 2000s, scientists conducted a DNA analysis of samples of digested food collected from his colon. Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s second-to-last meal consisted of ibex meat along with various species of cereals and dicots (a group of flowering plants). The discovery of red deer in his digestive system is especially interesting, since depictions of that animal figure prominently in archaeological finds throughout the Alps in this time period.', 'Between Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s top two teeth is a natural diastema, which is the anatomical term for a gap in the teeth. Among modern adults, about 10â\x80\x9320 percent have this gap. Researchers also saw in the Icemanâ\x80\x99s mouth third molar agenesisâ\x80\x94the anatomical term for lacking wisdom teeth. Around 35 percent of people today lack wisdom teeth. Ã\x96tzi was also missing some bonesâ\x80\x94the smallest of the ribs on either side. This lack of ribs is not unheard of, but it only affects about 5 percent of the population.', 'The Icemanâ\x80\x99s genome was sequenced in 2012, revealing he had brown eyes and O-type blood, was lactose intolerant, and likely had Lyme disease. The mutations in Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s paternal genetic line are most commonly found in Sardinia and Corsica today, meaning those areas likely have descendants of his genetic family. Another study in 2013 tested thousands of modern men in the Alps and discovered that 19 men in the sample shared a genetic lineage with the Iceman. His maternal DNA line, however, appears to be extinct. So if youâ\x80\x99re a guy and your ancestors go back to this roughly 620-mile band between Sardinia and the Alps, thereâ\x80\x99s a chance you could be related to Ã\x96tzi.', 'We all know that every ancient mummy is cursed, so of course the Iceman has his own story. In 2005, rumors circulated that the deaths of at least five people may have been related to a mummyâ\x80\x99s curse. Helmut Simon, one of the two hikers who discovered the Iceman, died falling off the side of a mountain. An Alpine guide who airlifted the mummy out of the glacier died in an avalanche. A journalist who filmed the recovery of the mummy died of a brain tumor. A forensic expert who touched Ã\x96tzi with his bare hands died in a car accident en route to a conference to talk about the mummy. Even the death of the head of the research team at Innsbruck University has been attributed to Ã\x96tziâ\x80\x99s curse, in spite of the fact it was from multiple sclerosis. There is, of course, no evidence that these deaths are related to anything other than bad luck or coincidence.', 'Ã\x96tzi has been thoroughly CT scanned over the years for analysis. In 2016, CT scans were meshed with digital photographs, 3D printed, and then painted to create three life-size Ã\x96tzi clones. The Icemanâ\x80\x99s first two 3D prints are on display at the DNA Learning Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, along with 3D printed bones from his body. The third life-size print remains at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, along with the real migratory hunter-herder, whose own journey has lasted more than 50 centuries.', 'A version of this story ran in 2016; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86519/13-mummified-facts-about-otzi-iceman

Thatâ\x80\x99s how far up World War II pilot Alan Magee was when he had to abandon his plane without a parachute. He crashed through a glass roof that likely helped spread out the impact. According to James Kakalios, a professor at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota, how and where you land is one of the major factors in whether you get up from the ground or go 6 feet further into it.', 'â\x80\x9cIf you can make the time [landing] longer, the force needed to stop you is smaller,â\x80\x9d he told Mental Floss in 2015. â\x80\x9cThink of punching a wall or a mattress. The wall is rigid and the time of interaction is short so the force is large. People who have survived falls, theyâ\x80\x99ve managed to increase that time, even if itâ\x80\x99s in milliseconds. From one millisecond to three, thatâ\x80\x99s three times longer, three times less force needed for the same change in momentum.â\x80\x9d Mageeâ\x80\x99s glass landing likely reduced the impact; other survivors have plummeted into snow, trees, or something that can better absorb your landing than, say, concrete.', 'The other major factor? Slowing your descent. Increasing surface area means more energy is required to push air out of your way, slowing you down. The â\x80\x9cflying squirrelâ\x80\x9d position, body splayed out, is preferred over falling feet or head first. â\x80\x9cIncreasing that drag is the biggest factor in keeping you alive,â\x80\x9d Kakalios said. A parachuteâ\x80\x99s large surface area is best, obviously. Without one, fall belly down or try tumbling. â\x80\x9cDrop a pen off the Empire State Building straight down and it might kill someone. But if it drops sideways, spinning end over end, it probably wouldnâ\x80\x99t.â\x80\x9d', 'Youâ\x80\x99re increasing air drag. Youâ\x80\x99re trying to land in snow or something absorbent. If youâ\x80\x99ve passed out from lack of oxygen at high altitudes, youâ\x80\x99ve woken up in time to orient yourself. Magee traveled 20,000 feetâ\x80\x94nearly four milesâ\x80\x94so you know survival is possible from there. What about going higher?', 'Kakalios stopped short of offering a prediction, citing the numerous variables involved. (â\x80\x9cEven how much clothing is fluttering behind you can affect surface profile,â\x80\x9d he said.) So we pestered someone else: Paul Doherty, a former physicist and co-director of the Exploratorium, a learning center in San Francisco, California. (He passed away in 2017.)', 'â\x80\x9cAs you get higher up, the air gets thinner and thinner,â\x80\x9d he told Mental Floss in 2015. â\x80\x9cYou can spin so fast the blood can rush into your head and kill you. Or the friction with the elevation will burn you up. Thatâ\x80\x99s why space shuttles have heat insulating tiles.â\x80\x9d', 'Once terminal velocity (a.k.a. maximum acceleration, usually 120 miles per hour for average-sized humans) is reached, Doherty said, it doesnâ\x80\x99t really matter whether you throw another 5000 or 10,000 feet on top of Mageeâ\x80\x99s 20,000: Youâ\x80\x99re not going to fall any faster. But start too high up and the lower atmospheric pressure means your blood might start to boil.

Do you enjoy the pungent odor of fuel as it wafts up from gas stations and seeps into your hands? Does the cocktail of hydrocarbons, antifreeze, and hundreds of other chemical compounds make you volunteer to jump out of a car in the dead of winter for a chance to pump-and-sniff?', 'Inhaling gas fumes is, of course, not recommended by anyone. But some people do seem to enjoy taking a whiff when the opportunity presents itself. And according to science, it may be less about getting a cheap buzz and more about nostalgia.', 'In a piece for Discover, Carl Engelking points out that gasoline gets its distinctive smell from benzene, a compound that increases octane levels and improves fuel efficiency. Benzene is easy to detect with our nose even when present in small amounts. And thereâ\x80\x99s precedent for finding the odor pleasant: In the 1800s, Engelking writes, benzene was an ingredient in aftershaves and feminine hygiene products.', 'But thatâ\x80\x99s a bit too far in the rearview to have modern relevance. The benzene aficionados of today are probably catching a sniff because scent and memory are closely related. Some call it the Proust phenomenon, named after author Marcel Proust, who once described the smell and taste of a madeleine dipped in tea as evoking childhood memories. The olfactory bulb, or the nerves that detect scent molecules, are closely tied in with the brainâ\x80\x99s amygdala (which processes emotional response) and hippocampus (which handles memory formation). Put simply, scents make us react on an emotional level.', 'Thatâ\x80\x99s likely why gasoline triggers a pleasant response. Thanks to driving around with parents, being taught to mow a lawn, or anything involving a motorized childhood memory, we associate the smell with a simpler time.', 'And unlike other smellsâ\x80\x94baking cookies, for exampleâ\x80\x94benzene actually has a suppressing effect on the nervous system. So one is, in a mild way, getting a bit of a high from it. In filling up at the pump, youâ\x80\x99re not only reminding yourself of your childhood. Youâ\x80\x99re also getting a slight buzz.', 'A quick nostalgia hit in the course of fueling a vehicle is not likely to create any health issues, but you should be aware that regularly indulging in solvent inhalation can lead to unpleasantness like balance problems, dementia, and tubular necrosis. So try not to regress into your childhood too much.', 'Now that you know why you enjoy the smell of gasoline, read up on why the gas pump nozzle always shuts off on you and why itâ\x80\x99s a bad idea to pump gas with the car running.', 'A version of this story ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/623813/reason-why-some-people-love-smell-of-gasoline

The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. The family had also reached an agreement with the National Institutes of Health in 2013 to control some access to the HeLa cellsâ\x80\x99 DNA. Speaking outside the court where the latest settlement was made, Lacksâ\x80\x99s grandson Alfred Lacks Carter, Jr., told the AP, â\x80\x9cIt was a long fightâ\x80\x94over 70 yearsâ\x80\x94and Henrietta Lacks gets her day.â\x80\x9d', 'On February 8, 1951, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, shaved a piece of cancerous tissue from the cervix of a 30-year-old woman. She had signed an â\x80\x9coperation permit,â\x80\x9d allowing him to place radium into her cervix to treat her cancer, but nobody had explained their plans to her. And no one foresaw that Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman with a sixth-grade education and five children, would become the mother of modern medicine.', 'Henrietta was born Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920, in Roanoke, Virginia. Somehow, her name became Henrietta. After her mother died in 1924, Henrietta was sent to Clover, Virginia, to live with her grandfather, Tommy Lacks. Her cousin David â\x80\x9cDayâ\x80\x9d Lacks lived in the same house.', 'Seventeen years later, after having two children together, Henrietta and Day married and then moved close to Baltimore so that Day could work at Bethlehem Steel while Henrietta took care of their growing family. She was big-hearted, fun-loving, and pretty, and though only 5 feet tall, she dressed and walked with a flare.', 'But on January 29, 1951, four months after the birth of her fifth child, Henrietta went to the dreaded hospital. Most Black people living in the Baltimore area did not trust Johns Hopkins. It was segregated, so they were certain they would not receive the same quality of care as white people, and, worse, they would be used for medical experiments. There were rumors that surgeons routinely performed hysterectomies on Black women who came in with any type of abdominal or pelvic pain. Henrietta was not one to complain, but, according to the 2010 book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot, she could no longer bear the painful â\x80\x9cknot on her womb.â\x80\x9d', 'The tissue taken from her cervix 10 days later was given to Dr. George Gey, director of tissue culture research at Hopkins. He believed that if he could find a continually dividing line of malignant human cells, all originating from the same sample, he could find the cause of cancerâ\x80\x94and its cure. His assistant placed tiny squares of the specimen into test tubes, then labeled each tube with the first two letters of the unwitting donorâ\x80\x99s first and last names: HeLa.', 'Soon, Henriettaâ\x80\x99s cells began to divide. And, unlike the other cells they had sampled, they did not die. Gey started giving the immortal cells to colleagues, saying they had come from a woman named Helen Lane.', 'Within two years, HeLa cells had been put into mass production, commercialized, and distributed worldwide, becoming central to the development of vaccines and many medical advances. By 2017, HeLa cells had been studied in 142 countries and had made possible research that led to two Nobel Prizes, 17,000 patents, and 110,000 scientific papers, thereby establishing Henriettaâ\x80\x99s role as the mother of modern medicine.', 'Henrietta had died on October 4, 1951. No one had told Henrietta, or her husband Day, that the cells still existed. No one had mentioned the myriad hopes and plans for HeLa cells. No one had asked permission to take them or use them.', 'In 1971, an article in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology reexamined the origin of the HeLa cells and reported that cervical adenocarcinoma had led to the death of the cell donor, Henrietta Lacks. Her name was now public knowledge.', 'Two years later, in a casual conversation with a friend, Henriettaâ\x80\x99s family learned about the cells. The Lackses were shocked: Henrietta was alive through her cells.', 'Then, a Rolling Stone article created an uproar in the scientific community by disclosing that the woman behind the cells was Black. Once again, the Lacks family was stunned. The article revealed that significant amounts of money were being made from the cellsâ\x80\x94while Henriettaâ\x80\x99s husband and children could not afford decent medical care and while her body lay in an unmarked grave.', 'More reports were written about Henriettaâ\x80\x99s cells. Intimate details from her medical record were exposed in a 1986 book called A Conspiracy of Cells: One Womanâ\x80\x99s Immortal Legacy and The Medical Scandal It Caused. Medical professionals came to draw blood from her children. The BBC made a movie, The Way of All Flesh. And, as Skloot reports, a con man claimed he could get money for the family from Johns Hopkins.', 'Meanwhile, and throughout subsequent decades, the Lacks familyâ\x80\x99s focus has been to try to figure out what it means to them that her cells are alive. They have received none of the billions of dollars the cells have garnered for biomedical companies, cell banks, and researchers. But Henriettaâ\x80\x99s family can be heartened that through the Henrietta Lacks Foundation, founded by Skloot in 2009, the mother of modern medicine continues to demonstrate her big-heartedness.', 'The foundationâ\x80\x99s mission is to â\x80\x9cprovide financial assistance to individuals in need, and their families, who have made important contributions to scientific research without personally benefiting from those contributions, particularly those used in research without their knowledge or consent.â\x80\x9d Moreover, it gives the countless people who have benefited from their contributions a way to show their appreciation to them.

They might also add time if theyâ\x80\x99re thinking outside the three-dimensional box. But asking a string theorist â\x80\x9cHow many dimensions are there?â\x80\x9d would elicit a very different response. According to this branch of theoretical physics, there are at least 10 dimensions of space, most of which are impossible for humans to perceive.', 'Dimensions are the metrics that physicists use to describe reality. Sounds broad, right? Letâ\x80\x99s start with the three dimensions most people learn in grade school. The spatial dimensionsâ\x80\x94width, height, and depthâ\x80\x94are the easiest to visualize. A horizontal line exists in one dimension because it has only length; a square is two-dimensional because it has length and width. Add depth and we get a cube, a three-dimensional shape.', 'These three coordinates are used to pinpoint an objectâ\x80\x99s location in space. But space isnâ\x80\x99t the only plane we exist on; we also exist in time, which is where the fourth dimension comes in. Once we know a dotâ\x80\x99s altitude, longitude, latitude, and position in time, we have the tools needed to plot its existence in the universe as we know it.', 'But some physicists who subscribe to string theory argue thereâ\x80\x99s more to reality than the observable universe. String theory, also known as â\x80\x9csuperstring theory,â\x80\x9d aims to unify two main theories describing how the universe works: general relativity (which applies to very large objects) and quantum mechanics (which applies to very small ones). In a four-dimensional universe, this theory wouldnâ\x80\x99t be possible, but once scientists tweaked the math to include 10 dimensionsâ\x80\x9411 including timeâ\x80\x94their equations worked.', 'After coming up with a theory that hinges on the existence of 10 space dimensions, string theorists then had the job of explaining where those new dimensions were hiding. Their answer: They are just as real as the â\x80\x9cbigâ\x80\x9d dimensions we can see, but the extra dimensions are curled up so tightly that theyâ\x80\x99re too small for us to notice directly.', 'Our basic understanding of physics makes this hard to process, but string theorist Brian Greene does a great job of framing the concept in terms most people can understand. In his 2005 TED Talk, Greene compares these invisible dimensions to the cables connected to telephone poles: From a window, a wire looks like a one-dimensional line. But if we were to study it up close weâ\x80\x99d see that the cord is actually round, making it three-dimensional. No analogy comparing unobservable dimensions to objects in the observable world can ever be perfect, but this illustrates how something so fundamental to reality could be hiding in plain sight.', 'String theory states there must be at least 10 dimensions of space plus one dimension for time, but there are physicists who argue that there are more. Some posit a universe composed of 11 space dimensions. But to really blow someoneâ\x80\x99s mind when they ask how many dimensions there are, say 26: Thatâ\x80\x99s the magic number according to Bosonic string theory, and itâ\x80\x99s as high as mainstream physicists are willing to go for the time being.', 'Have you got a Big Question youâ\x80\x99d like us to answer?

In the remarks after the description, Garman noted that', 'Such an animal as that described is very likely to unsettle disbelief in what is popularly called the â\x80\x9csea serpent.â\x80\x9d Though it could hardly on examination be taken for anything but a shark, its appearance in the forward portion of the body, particularly in the head, brings vividly to mind the triangular heads, deep-cleft mouths, and fierce looks of many of our most dreaded snakes. In view of the possible discoveries of the future, the fact of the existence of such creatures, so recently undiscovered, certainly calls for a suspension of judgment in regard to the non-existence of that oft-appearing but elusive creature, the serpent-like monster of the oceans.', 'The frilled sharkâ\x80\x99s species name, anguineus, is Latin for â\x80\x9cconsisting of snakesâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9csnaky.â\x80\x9d', 'Biologist David A. Ebert, director of the Pacific Shark Research Center, described a second frilled shark speciesâ\x80\x94Chlamydoselachus africana, which lives off the coast of Africa and is about half as long as its predecessorâ\x80\x94in 2009.', 'The frilled sharkâ\x80\x99s mouth is just as terrifying as the maw of a great white: Itâ\x80\x99s lined with 25 rows of backward-facing, trident-shaped teethâ\x80\x94300 in all. â\x80\x9cThe teeth are constructed for grasping and from their peculiar shape and sharpness it would seem as if nothing that once came within their reach could escape them,â\x80\x9d Garman wrote. â\x80\x9cEven in the dead specimen the formidable three-pronged teeth make the mouth a troublesome one to explore.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Ebert can testify to that fact. â\x80\x9cI can tell you from snagging my fingers on the teeth, you can only back out one way and thatâ\x80\x99s in toward the mouth and then out,â\x80\x9d he told WIRED. â\x80\x9cIt didnâ\x80\x99t feel good, I can tell you that.â\x80\x9d The shark uses the bright white teeth, which sharply contrast against its brown body, to lure in prey: â\x80\x9cBy the time [the prey] realize, Oh, thatâ\x80\x99s the teeth of a shark, theyâ\x80\x99re too close and the shark is able to ambush them at that point,â\x80\x9d Ebert said. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s almost like when you drive out of a parking lot exit and they have the spikes sticking out that say, â\x80\x98Do not back up.â\x80\x99 Thatâ\x80\x99s kind of what happens when these things catch prey items.â\x80\x9d', 'And as if its teeth werenâ\x80\x99t freaky enough, the frilled shark has spines, called dermal denticles, lining its mouth. So if you happen to see one of these anywhere, itâ\x80\x99s better to look and not touch.', 'Scientists once believed that the frilled shark wriggled through the water like an eel. But according to the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research, â\x80\x9cits body cavity is elongate and packed with a huge liver perfused with low-density oils and hydrocarbons, making the shark almost neutrally buoyant at depth.â\x80\x9d', 'No one has ever observed the frilled shark hunting, but scientists believe that it uses its posterior fins as propulsive surfaces to launch itself at its prey. Its long jaws, which terminate at the back of its head, may allow the animal to gape extra wide and take in prey half as long as its body. Analysis of the stomach contents of captured specimens has revealed that the frilled sharkâ\x80\x99s diet is 61 percent cephalopod, 11 percent teleost fishes, and, occasionally, other sharks.', 'The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations notes that the frilled shark is â\x80\x9cwide-ranging but spottily distributedâ\x80\x9d; you can see where the shark is found on the map above. It typically resides in depths between 390 and 4200 feet, so people rarely see these sharks unless they venture to the surface, which isnâ\x80\x99t unheard of (as youâ\x80\x99ll see below).', 'On average, males range from 3.2 to 3.6 feet and females from 4.4 to 4.9 feet; the maximum these sharks can reach is 6.4 feet.', 'A study of frilled sharks in Japan revealed that the animals breed year-round; litters typically consist of six pups, whichÂ\xa0emerge from eggs while still in the motherâ\x80\x99s uterus and are then born live. Scientists think the shark may have the longest gestation period ever: Frilled sharks could gestate for as long as 42 months, nearly twice as long as African elephants carry their young. Scientists theorize that the extreme length has something to do with the sharkâ\x80\x99s cold deep sea habitat.', 'NOAA scientists exploring the â\x80\x9cLatitude 31-30 Transectâ\x80\x9d in the Atlantic Ocean captured a video of a frilled shark â\x80\x9cswimming over sea bottom that was covered with tiny sand dunesâ\x80\x9d during a submersible dive. â\x80\x9cThis species has been, on rare occasion, caught or taken in bottom trawls,â\x80\x9d the site notes. â\x80\x9cTo the knowledge of everyone on board, however, this was the first time anyone had ever seen the rare species in its natural habitat.â\x80\x9d', '\nIn January 2007, a Japanese fisherman spotted a strange, eel-like creature with a mouth full of sharp teeth near the surface; he alerted the staff of the Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka, who captured the animal and transferred it to a seawater pool, where they filmed it. â\x80\x9cWe think it may have come close to the surface because it was sick, or else it was weakened because it was in shallow waters,â\x80\x9d a park official said. â\x80\x9cWe believe moving pictures of a live specimen are extremely rare. They live between 600 and 1000 meters under the water, which is deeper than humans can go.â\x80\x9d The shark, a female, died a few hours after its capture.', 'The frilled shark might have rows upon rows of gnarly teeth, but its cousin, the goblin shark, can thrust its jaw out of its face.

128,The Scientists Who Opposed the Manhattan Project,"['science', 'physics', 'history', 'military', 'war']","['â\x80\x9cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,â\x80\x9d physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer said to himself as he watched the first-ever nuclear mushroom cloud form over the Jornada del Muerto desert in New Mexico. The famous quote, borrowed from an ancient Hindu scripture known as the Bhagavad-Gita, raises an important but often overlooked question: why did Oppenheimer and his colleagues agree to create a weapon that, in addition to killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens, could one day end all life on Earth?', 'Of the estimated 130,000 people who participated in the Manhattan Project, the vast majority had no idea what exactly they were building. Like assembly line workers, they performed their small, specialized tasks without ever being shown the bigger picture. Those who did see it had their reasons for staying on board. Some wanted money: the projectâ\x80\x99s wages were reportedly better than average. Others acted out of patriotism, seeking revenge for the lives lost at Pearl Harbor. Others still were motivated by scientific curiosity. â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re working on something thatâ\x80\x99s more important than the discovery of electricity,â\x80\x9d chemist Glenn Seaborg, who headed the plutonium division, told his recruits. â\x80\x9cThis almost always brought them in.â\x80\x9d', 'Emphasis on â\x80\x9calmostâ\x80\x9d as, for a small number of scientists, these promises of fame and fortune were not worth their moral cost. â\x80\x9cI will have nothing to do with a bomb!â\x80\x9d Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist credited with the discovery of nuclear fission, responded when she was approached to join the Manhattan Project. Meitner was accompanied by the Italian physicist Franco Rasetti, a longtime collaborator with Enrico Fermi, as well as Noble Prize-winner Isidor Rabi. Rabi refused an offer from Oppenheimer to become deputy director of the entire project, serving only in limited capacity as a consultant.', 'Some scientists joined the Manhattan Project only to oppose it down the line when they came to grasp its destructive potential. Polish-British physicist Joseph Rotblat arrived at the laboratory at Los Alamos in 1944 to head its theoretical division, but left later that year when scientists learned that Nazi Germany was nowhere close to developing an atomic bomb of its own. (Countering the Nazisâ\x80\x99 potential atomic arsenal had been an original purpose of the Manhattan Project.) Long accused of Soviet espionage, Rotblat was not allowed back into the U.S. until 1964. Such accusations did not stop his anti-nuclear crusade, however, and in 1993 he published a book arguing in favor of dismantling every weapon of mass destruction on the planet.', 'Another scientist who came to regret his time at Los Alamos was Leo Szilard. The Hungarian-American physicist had been one of the people who, alongside Albert Einstein, had helped get the Manhattan Project off the ground. In 1945, he went from department to department collecting signatures for a petition to dissuade President Harry Truman from dropping their terrible creations onto Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The petition, signed by more than 70 experts, argued that, while the Second World War needed to be â\x80\x9cbrought speedily to a successful conclusion,â\x80\x9d any attack on Japan could not be justified until the country had been given an opportunity to surrender. More importantly, perhaps, the petitioners felt that the U.S., as the first country to possess nuclear weapons, should set an example for the rest of the world by refraining from using them:', 'â\x80\x9cThe development of atomic power will provide the nations with new means of destruction. The atomic bombs at our disposal represent only the first step in this direction, and there is almost no limit to the destructive power which will become available in the course of their future development. Thus a nation which sets the precedent of using these newly liberated forces of nature for purposes of destruction may have to bear the responsibility of opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.â\x80\x9d', 'With his petition, Szilard antagonized the federal government, the military, and Oppenheimer, who made sure none of the scientists stationed at the Los Alamos lab was given a chance to sign the document. Oppenheimer believed there was no point to developing something that was never going to be tested. â\x80\x9cIf you are a scientist you cannot stop such a thing,â\x80\x9d he said during his farewell speech in 1945. â\x80\x9cIf you are a scientist you believe that it is good to find out how the world works; that it is good to find out what the realities are; that it is good to turn over to mankind at large the greatest possible power to control the world and to deal with it according to its lights and its values.â\x80\x9d', 'Oppenheimer did experience a change of heart later in life, when he came to oppose the advent of hydrogen bombs on grounds that they were even more destructive than their atomic counterparts. But his pleas, like those of his colleagues before him, came too late. Rotblat never convinced world leaders to agree to a global nuclear disarmament. Szilardâ\x80\x99s petition never reached Trumanâ\x80\x94incoming Secretary of State James F. Byrnes had declined to show it to him.

129,10 Fascinating Facts About J. Robert Oppenheimer,"['history', 'lists', 'Robert Oppenheimer']","[""He directed the laboratory that built and successfully tested the first atomic bomb. Then, once it became possible for mankind to build an even more dangerous weapon, he became an outspoken critic of the nuclear arms race and was put on trial by the very government he once served. Here are 10 essential facts about Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic physicist at the center of Christopher Nolan's newest film.Â\xa0Â\xa0"", 'Oppenheimer majored in chemistry as a Harvard undergrad and later made a name for himself as a physicist, but rocks and minerals were his first scientific love. Born in New York City on April 22, 1902, he used to collect rock samples in Manhattan and the Hudson River Palisades as a boy.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cBy the age of 12, he was using the family typewriter to correspond with a number of well-known geologists about the rock formations he had studied in Central Park. Not aware of his youth, one of these correspondents nominated Robert for membership in the New York Mineralogical Club, and soon thereafter a letter arrived inviting him to deliver a lecture before the club,â\x80\x9d write biographers Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin in their book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Encouraged by his parents, young Oppenheimer gave the speech and got a round of applause for his efforts, though he needed to stand on a box in order to see over the podium.Â\xa0', 'NASA describes cosmic rays as a â\x80\x9cpuzzling form of radiationâ\x80\x9d that consist of â\x80\x9celectrically charged, subatomic particles that crash into our atmosphere, where they are broken up and fall to Earth in even smaller fragments.â\x80\x9d You might say Oppenheimer was an early fan. In 1931 he and a student named Frank Carlson co-wrote the first of many scientific papers about the physics of cosmic raysâ\x80\x94a relatively new phenomenon that had only been discovered in 1912, less than 20 years earlier.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Oppenheimer hailed from a (non-observant) German Jewish family. In 1937, he used his own money to sponsor his Aunt Hedwig and her son Alfredâ\x80\x94plus Alfredâ\x80\x99s familyâ\x80\x94when they fled their home to come stateside after Hitler rose to power.Â\xa0', 'The physicist was just 38 years old in 1943, when General Leslie R. Groves chose him to direct the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. On paper, he was an unlikely candidate for the job. Yes, Oppenheimer had already received his Ph.D. and was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley at the time. But as the National Parks Service website points out, the â\x80\x9cthin, chain-smoking Oppenheimer was â\x80\x98eccentricâ\x80\x99 by his own admission, had relatively little administrative experience, had not won a Nobel Prize, and had relatives who were suspected of being Communist sympathizers.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Nevertheless, he soon proved his mettle. The Los Alamos teamâ\x80\x99s core objective was the top-secret Manhattan Project, a secret campaign to invent the first nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer managed everything from the salaries to the living quarters at the LANL, and had a real talent for settling disagreements that flared up between scientists and military personnel connected to the Manhattan Project.Â\xa0Â\xa0It was at this New Mexico lab that Oppenheimer earned the nickname â\x80\x9cFather of the Atomic Bomb.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Privately, Oppenheimer said his material wasnâ\x80\x99t â\x80\x9cmeant or fit for anyoneâ\x80\x99s perusal,â\x80\x9d but he had a passion for verse and creative writing. One of his poems, a somber meditation titled â\x80\x9cCrossingâ\x80\x9d even appeared in an issue of the Harvard literary magazine, Hound & Horn. Hereâ\x80\x99s how that one goes:Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cIt was evening when we came to the river with a low moon over the desert that we had lost in the mountains, forgotten, what with the cold and the sweating and the ranges barring the sky.â\x80\x9cAnd when we found it again, in the dry hills down by the river, half withered, we had the hot winds against us.â\x80\x9cThere were two palms by the landing; the yuccas were flowering; there was a light on the far shore, and tamarisks.â\x80\x9cWe waited a long time, in silence.Then we heard the oars creaking and afterwards, I remember, the boatman called to us.We did not look back at the mountains.â\x80\x9d', 'Oppenheimer couldnâ\x80\x99t help but think of the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu text which recounts a conversation between a human prince and the god Vishnu on the eve of a great battle, on July 16, 1945â\x80\x94the day of the infamous Trinity Nuclear Test. At 5:29 a.m. (Mountain Time), the LANL staff made history by becoming the first people to successfully detonate an atomic bomb.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Oppenheimer famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita in a 1965 TV documentary when he reflected on the test, and how it made him feel. Itâ\x80\x99s arguably the best-known comment he ever made, and an eerie testament to the world-changing power his team unleashed at Los Alamos:Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cWe knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, theÂ\xa0Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, â\x80\x98Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.â\x80\x99 I suppose we all felt that, one way or another.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'In 1949, four years after Trinity, the Soviet Union tested a nuclear bomb of their own. The device worked, threatening to alter the balance of power in the Cold War.Â\xa0 Not wanting to lose ground in the arms race, President Harry S Truman signed off on the development of an experimental new weapon, one that would become even more devastating than its predecessor: the hydrogen bomb.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'Oppenheimer was very much against it. Since 1946, he had been involved with the General Advisory Committee (GAC) to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Following that Soviet nuclear test, Oppenheimer led a GAC discussion panel about the ethics and feasibility of H-bomb research.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cThe committee concluded that it shouldnâ\x80\x99t be built because this was a weapon of genocide that had absolutely no military necessity, and that our stockpile of atomic bombs was a sufficient deterrent,â\x80\x9d biographer Martin J. Sherwin said in The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a 2008 PBS documentary.Â\xa0', 'Nevertheless, the United States ultimately went ahead with the project. America conducted its first successful hydrogen bomb test on November 1, 1952, over the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The explosion released around 1000 times more energy than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan had in 1945.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'By the 1950s, there were concerns that the Soviets had stolen American nuclear secretsâ\x80\x94and that didnâ\x80\x99t bode well for Oppenheimer. The physicist had befriended a number of avowed communists over the years, though historians arenâ\x80\x99t sure if he ever joined their party himself. And then there was the hydrogen bomb issue: Some of Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s political enemies, including fellow scientist Edward Teller, thought his opposition to the H bomb was unpatriotic at best.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cTeller sincerely believed that we were in a dangerous arms race with the Russians, and that Oppenheimer was standing in the way of protecting the country against this dreaded foe,â\x80\x9d said physicist Marvin Goldberg in The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer.Â\xa0', 'On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer received a letter from the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission telling him that heâ\x80\x99d been labeled a security risk. Though he came under pressure to resign from the GAC, Oppenheimer pushed for a hearing insteadâ\x80\x94and he got one.Â\xa0', 'Right from the start, the court case stood on uneven ground. â\x80\x9cThe defense suffered from a lack of access: none of Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s defense team had security clearance, and therefore they could not see pivotal documents, including information from Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s FBI file and some of his own writings, that the prosecution had access to. Oppenheimer served as the defenseâ\x80\x99s memory, but frequently censored himself, out of a fear of unintentionally spilling classified information,â\x80\x9d according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation website.Â\xa0', 'Although the panel that decided his fate conceded that heâ\x80\x99d been a â\x80\x9cloyal citizen,â\x80\x9d they voted to revoke Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s security clearanceâ\x80\x94a decision supported by the Atomic Energy Commission.Â\xa0', 'Eighteen people who worked with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos were able to put â\x80\x9cNobel Prize Winnerâ\x80\x9d on their lifetime resumes. But though Oppenheimer himself received three nominations for the Nobel Prize in Physicsâ\x80\x94once in 1946, and again in 1951 and 1967â\x80\x94he never won it.Â\xa0', 'However, in 1963, the â\x80\x9cFather of the Atomic Bombâ\x80\x9d did get to take home the prestigious Enrico Fermi Award, in recognition of his â\x80\x9cespecially meritorious contribution to the development, use or control of atomic energy.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Before his death in Princeton, New Jersey, on February 18, 1967, public opinion had definitely shifted back in Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s favor. Scientists and activists spent decades pushing the government to clear his name, and their efforts finally paid offâ\x80\x94albeit not until 2022. On December 16 of that year, the U.S. Department of Energy formally reversed the 1954 ruling that had stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cAs time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed,â\x80\x9d Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote in a press release.Â\xa0', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/j-robert-oppenheimer-facts-history

Some species can transmit Lyme disease, while a bite from others might make you allergic to red meat. While you may believe you need to come into direct contact with a tick to be susceptible to these ailments, it turns out that the rude little arachnid can actually cover a bit of distance to make a meal out of you. The secret? Static electricity.', 'In a study published in Current Biology, researchers examined the bean tick, a common European species that can carry numerous pathogens and transmit diseases to humans. When the ticks were positioned near electrodes, they were able to surf the static electricity and travel a fraction of an inch through the air, like a tick Michael Jordan flying toward the basket.', 'While it may not sound like a huge distance, relative to a tickâ\x80\x99s size itâ\x80\x99s a considerable achievement. Sam England, one of the studyâ\x80\x99s authors, told the Associated Press that â\x80\x9citâ\x80\x99s the equivalent of [humans] jumping three or four flights of stairs in one go.â\x80\x9d', 'Researchers already knew that ticks engage in â\x80\x9cquesting,â\x80\x9d or hanging out on a blade of grass with their legs outstretched in the hopes of making contact with a host. The new research confirms that ticks actually have a little bit of space they can traverse, with the tiny amount of static electricity needed generated by clothing or fur. The action works vertically or horizontally, helping ticks defeat gravity in their search for a blood meal. The static also allows them to settle in without falling off too quickly.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s possible, the study notes, that fleas and mites also possess this ability, though it has not yet been proven.', ""While this novel method of transport makes ticks more likely to hitch a ride on your body, itâ\x80\x99s a myth that they dive-bomb from trees.

131,"10 Facts About Neutrinos, the Weirdest Particles in the Universe","['physics', 'science', 'weird', 'lists']","['Ghost particles. Thatâ\x80\x99s what many physicists call neutrinos, the almost mass-less subatomic particles that are all around us, all of the time. Youâ\x80\x99d never know it, and it usually takes experiments the size of swimming pools or larger to catch them. But theyâ\x80\x99re crucial pieces in the particle physics puzzle that describes everything we see in the universe. And theyâ\x80\x99re freaking weird.', 'Here are some of the bizarre things physicist Alan Chodos and I found out about neutrinos as we wrote our book Ghost Particle: In Search of the Elusive and Mysterious Neutrino.', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s a flood of neutrinos rushing through us, the Earth, and everything around us at about the speed of light. They come from nuclear reactions in the core of the sun. There, protons fusing together into helium put out light, energy and gazillions of neutrinos.Â\xa0', 'In your entire lifetime, one or two solar neutrinos will hit an atom in your body. But considering that youâ\x80\x99re made of trillions of billions of atoms, you wonâ\x80\x99t notice a thing.', 'The flood of neutrinos from the sun is nothing compared to the neutrinos that are the oldest particles in existence. Theyâ\x80\x99re ancient relics of the Big Bang that got the universe going. The relic neutrinos emerged about 13.8 billion years ago when the universe exploded into existence and have been gliding around ever since. Theyâ\x80\x99ve slowed down and spread out as the universe expanded. So, unlike solar neutrinos that zip along at about the speed of light, Big Bang relic neutrinos fill the cosmos like a sea of particles that, so far, are essentially invisible.', 'Along with the 300 or so inside your pinky at this instant, there are about 15 million in the rest of you. Altogether, there are more neutrinos in the universe than the total of all the quarks, electrons, and other massive particles put together.', 'Even a thin lead shield can protect you from X-rays, but it would take a trillion miles of lead to block out neutrinos from the sun. The penetrating abilities of neutrinos is why physicist Hans Bethe once published a formal science paper concluding that no practical experiments could ever detect the ghostly particles. They would always remain simply a hypothetical, invented to make sure particle physics calculations came out right.', 'Considering that he would later win the Nobel Prize for explaining the reactions that produce energy in the sun, including the key role that neutrinos play in solar fusion, Betheâ\x80\x99s prediction seemed to doom any hope that neutrinos would ever be detectable.', 'Ironically, Bethe helped make atomic bombs possible, and spurred the construction of nuclear reactors to supply fuel for nuclear weapons, both of which produce lots of neutrinos. The odds of any given neutrino turning up in a detector is still vanishingly small, but when trillions come from bombs and reactors, the chance of seeing a few in an experiment goes up.Â\xa0', 'A huge flux of neutrinos served as the basis for an experiment by physicists Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines to confirm the existence of neutrinos. They set up their test near one of the reactors making plutonium for U.S. nuclear weapons in 1956. For their underground detector, they used two giant tanks containing cadmium chloride dissolved in water, placed between tanks filled with scintillator (a substance that gives off a flash of light in response to gamma rays). Cowan and Reines predicted, correctly, that a few neutrinos per hour would interact with the cadmium chloride solution, produce gamma rays, and appear as light.', 'Neutrino detectors around the world have scaled up the basic design of Cowan and Reinesâ\x80\x99s experiment. These huge facilities employ vast amounts of water, ice, or other substances to ensure the detection of neutrinos, and are often located underground to avoid interference from cosmic rays. Todayâ\x80\x99s detectors include ANTARES, suspended over the Mediterranean seabed; Gran Sasso National Laboratory within an Italian mountain; Kamioka Observatory inside a Japanese zinc mine; and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried deep in the Antarctic ice sheet.', 'When Reines later confronted Bethe about his old thinking that no one would ever see a neutrino in an experiment, Bethe reputedly said, â\x80\x9cYou shouldnâ\x80\x99t believe everything you read in the papers.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'We shouldnâ\x80\x99t be here, and neither should anything else. When the Big Bang exploded, it made lots of matterâ\x80\x94quarks, electrons, and eventually protons and neutrons. It also made exactly the same amount of antimatterâ\x80\x94substances made with particles having the opposite electrical charges, called antiquarks, antielectrons, and so on.', 'But when matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other. There should be nothing left after all the matter and antimatter from the Big Bang destroyed each other. And yet, here we are with no antimatter in sight, in a world filled with plain old matter. Neutrinos could be why.', 'If, as many physicists believe, antineutrinos can spontaneously convert into matter neutrinos, and vice versa, it might explain why matter beats out antimatter in the cosmos.', 'Each time an antimatter neutrino changes to a matter version, the total amount of matter in the universe goes up ever so slightly. As long as it happens just a bit more often than matter neutrinos turning into antimatter neutrinos, it would explain why thereâ\x80\x99s any matter left in the universe at all.', 'Scientists hope to catch antimatter neutrinos turning into their matter versions soon. If those experiments are successful, theyâ\x80\x99ll show how neutrinos were key to making and you and me possible, along with just about everything else in the universe.', 'A typical solar neutrino could pass through trillions of miles of lead more easily than light shines through a windowpane. Youâ\x80\x99re almost completely transparent to them. On the very rare occasion that a solar neutrino interacts inside you, it will convert one of your atoms into a different type of atom, but you wonâ\x80\x99t notice a thing.', 'Next-generation accelerators that will push particles called muons to super high energies, though, will also make potentially dangerous neutrino beams. Energetic ghost particles will emerge from the accelerators when muons break down into electrons.Â\xa0', 'The neutrinos themselves arenâ\x80\x99t the problem. Youâ\x80\x99d be fine if you stood in front of a high energy neutrino beam because it would mostly pass through you. Some of those neutrinos, though, will interact with atoms in you to produce bursts of dangerous secondary radiation blasting out behind you. It wonâ\x80\x99t hurt you, but anyone standing in back of you could be in big trouble from the secondary blast.', 'Youâ\x80\x99re better off getting zapped by a high energy neutrino beam directly than you would be hiding behind even a mountain of lead thatâ\x80\x99s being hit by the beam, thanks to all the secondary radiation coming out behind. Researchers planning next-generation muon accelerators are keeping neutrino dangers in mind. Solutions might include aiming energetic neutrino beams skyward or wiggling the beams around to ensure that the neutrinos, and any secondary radiation bursts they might create, are spread out to reduce the danger.Â\xa0', 'Like the chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla trifecta that makes up Neapolitan ice cream, neutrinos come in three flavors: electron, muon, and tau. They get their flavor names because the neutrinos are cousins to the electron, muon, and tau particles. The thing that sets neutrinos apart from any other particle is that they are perpetually shifting from one flavor to the next as they travel through space.', 'That weird flavor-changing baffled scientists for decades. Physicists had assumed neutrinos were massless, like photons. That should mean that neutrinos travel at the speed of light, just like photons. But Einsteinâ\x80\x99s theory of special relativity says that time slows down for things that move fast. Itâ\x80\x99s a principle known as time dilation. The closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time moves for you. Your clock stops altogether if you go exactly at the speed of light.Â\xa0', 'The same is true of neutrinos. If they move at the speed of light, time stands still for them, and they canâ\x80\x99t change. But they do change as they shift flavors. That means they have at least some mass, but we donâ\x80\x99t yet know how much. It could even be â\x80\x9cimaginary mass,â\x80\x9d which means â\x80¦', 'The speed of light is what most people think of as the ultimate speed limit in the universe. Particles that break that limit are called tachyons. Theyâ\x80\x99re like a physics version of Bigfootâ\x80\x94probably mythical but (to some people anyway) not yet ruled out.', 'In 2011, physicists thought they clocked neutrinos exceeding light speed. For a few months, it looked like a lot of physics textbooks would need an update. It turned out to be an experimental error, but it didnâ\x80\x99t prove that neutrinos canâ\x80\x99t go faster than light.', 'Most physicists think neutrinos obey the same speed limits as everything else. But there are no experiments yet that can tell us for sure whether neutrinos are super-speedy tachyons.', 'If they can exceed the speed of light, it would be the weirdest thing about them of all.', 'If the fusion reactions driving the sun were to suddenly wink off, we wouldnâ\x80\x99t see a change in the sunshine for nearly a quarter-million years, but neutrino researchers would know about it right away. Thatâ\x80\x99s because itâ\x80\x99s taken hundreds of thousands of years for the light from the solar core to rattle its way through the sunâ\x80\x99s atoms and into space. Neutrinos born in the same reactions that ultimately make sunlight, however, sail through the sun unhindered and arrive here on Earth at a scant eight minutes old. These newborn ghost particles offer a unique, and nearly real-time, view of the very heart of our sun.', 'Ghost particles can also give us insights into the traumas suffered by some distant stars. A sudden burst in detectors around the world tracking neutrinos from space could serve as a sort of starting gun, alerting us to look skyward for a supernova explosion that comes at the end of some starsâ\x80\x99 life cycles. The neutrinos from a supernova will arrive hours before thereâ\x80\x99s any visible sign that a star has blown up, giving astronomers a nudge to catch the supernova when it first appears. Monitoring the neutrinos streaming out of a star just before and during the next nearby supernova will provide us with an unprecedented view inside of one of the most extreme cataclysms in the universe.Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'And remember all those relic neutrinos, the ones in the tip of your pinky? Theyâ\x80\x99re links to the very beginning of time. We donâ\x80\x99t have a good way to study them right now. But eventually, they will offer up exclusive baby pictures of the universe, as seen through neutrino telescopes.', 'Nothing else can give us a peek into the heart of the living sun, the death throes of a supernova, or the very first moments of the universe. It takes neutrinos.', 'Supernovas are among the most violent events in the universe. They come about when stars like our sun reach the end of their lives, collapse, and then explode again in a burst with the energy of a thousand-megaton nuclear bomb. ', 'Ninety-nine percent of that energy comes out in the form of neutrinos. If the red star Betelgeuse were to go supernova, as some people believe will happen soon, the first sign of it on Earth would be a sudden uptick in neutrinos in detectors around the world. The visual fireworks will follow a few hours laterâ\x80\x94and it will be spectacular. The dying star will become brighter and even be visible to us during the day for a week or two before petering out. Itâ\x80\x99s too bad the best part of the show will be in nearly imperceptible neutrinos.', 'Light years of lead are nothing to neutrinos, which means sending the particles through the planet should be a breeze. Electrical signals, light, or radio waves have to go around the planet to carry messages. Neutrino-based signals, on the other hand, could take a shortcut straight through the center of the Earth. Scientists have already tested the concept by sending a neutrino message through 10 kilometers of solid rock.', 'Some economists have suggested that investing a few billion dollars in a neutrino communication system might give an advantage to stock traders who rely on the very latest market data from around the world.', 'And if an alien wanted to chat with us from a distant place in the universe, neutrinos could very well be the best way to do it. Light and radio waves are absorbed, distorted, and scattered by dust and anything else they encounter in space. A beam of neutrinos could carry clear messages through light years of dust, planets, and even stars.', 'We donâ\x80\x99t have the machines to send neutrino messages to distant planets at the moment.

132,"What Is El NiÃ±o, and Why Does It Have Such a Big Impact?","['science', 'weather', 'How on Earth']","['El NiÃ±o has taken on an almost legendary quality in the United States, entering the collective mind of the public in the late 1990s as an epic weather pattern that drenches California in an unending deluge of tropical moisture.', 'An El NiÃ±o is the abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The event occurs when winds over the Pacific Ocean near the equator slow down or reverse direction, allowing unusually warm water to accumulate around the eastern part of the equatorial Pacific. When sea surface temperatures in this portion of the Pacific climb 0.5Â°C above average for seven consecutive months, itâ\x80\x99s officially considered an El NiÃ±o. An upward shift of one-half of one degree doesnâ\x80\x99t sound like muchâ\x80\x94but, in a similar way to a fever in the human body, it doesnâ\x80\x99t take a lot of abnormal heat to make a huge impact both on the ocean and the atmosphere above it.', 'How can warm water in the Pacific Ocean affect the weather thousands of miles away? Everything is connected. One of the most heavily advertised effects of El NiÃ±o is that it can squash the Atlantic hurricane season as the warm water triggers thunderstorms in the eastern Pacific, causing strong upper-level winds to flow east over the Caribbean and Atlantic. This wind shear tears the tops off thunderstorms, keeping tropical activity to a minimum. However, the warmer water can also alter the jet stream, which is how we most commonly feel its influence here in the United States.', 'The jet stream is a fast-moving river of air in the upper levels of the atmosphere thatâ\x80\x99s usually located between 25,000 and 35,000 feet, the typical cruising altitude for commercial jets. This ribbon of powerful winds is caused by the temperature difference between the tropics and the poles. Weather exists as a result of nature trying to balance itself outâ\x80\x94in this case in the Northern Hemisphere, rising warm air in the tropics flows north toward the Arctic, turning east thanks to the Coriolis effect. The resulting river of westerly winds is the jet stream.', 'During the summer months, the jet stream is usually weaker and stuck in the higher latitudes. This is why weather is generally calmer during the summer, allowing long stretches of hot, humid weather only broken by occasional pop-up thunderstorms. During the cooler months, however, the north-south temperature gradient is much sharper, allowing the jet stream to dive south over the United States (and sometimes even farther south than that). This curvy, dippy jet stream provides us a constant offering of volatile weather, bringing everything from heavy rain or snow to extreme bouts of cold weather.', 'This is where El NiÃ±o factors in. There are actually two jet streams in the Northern Hemisphere: the polar jet stream, which circulates in the higher latitudes, and the subtropical jet stream, which weâ\x80\x99ll often find around the southern United States. The polar jet is what brings us our deep shots of frigid air during the dead of winter, and the subtropical jet is often at least partially responsible for the huge, historic snowstorms that occasionally whomp the East Coast.', 'When the water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is abnormally warm like it is during an El NiÃ±o, it can affect air temperature above the surface. The warmer air allows the subtropical jet stream to grow stronger and establish itself over the southern United States, shoving the polar jet stream farther north near the U.S.-Canada border. This brings stormy weather to the southern half of the United States, often manifesting itself in wet low-pressure systems that smack California before slowly trundling across the rest of the country. This also tends to keep the northern United States drier and warmer than normal, though snowy conditions and arctic blasts arenâ\x80\x99t uncommon.', 'If you hear people talk about El NiÃ±o causing flooding and snow out west or news anchors report that â\x80\x9cEl NiÃ±o brought heavy rain to Los Angeles yet again today,â\x80\x9d take comfort in the fact that you now know thatâ\x80\x99s not true. El NiÃ±o doesnâ\x80\x99t directly cause rain or snow or heat or cold in the United States, and El NiÃ±o doesnâ\x80\x99t make landfall like a hurricane, either, since itâ\x80\x99s just abnormally warm ocean water. El NiÃ±o wonâ\x80\x99t always be the cause of our weather woes, but it sure doesnâ\x80\x99t help.', 'A version of this story ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74582/what-el-nino-and-why-does-it-have-such-big-impact

One of the most common suggestions is to eliminate or reduce single-use plastic bags from your shopping errands. Thatâ\x80\x99s because the bags decompose slowly, causing them to linger in landfills. But how long does a plastic bag really stick around?', 'According to the Center for Biological Diversity, it takes about 1000 years (10 centuries) for a bag to â\x80\x9cdecompose.â\x80\x9d But thatâ\x80\x99s a bit of a misnomer. Because most microorganisms canâ\x80\x99t eat plastic, it winds up photodegrading from ultraviolet radiation. And even when bags disintegrate, they leave behind microplastics that can continue to have an adverse effect on the environment.', ""While 1000 years sounds foreboding, it is, of course, an estimate. Plastic bags have only been around since the 1950s or so, meaning that civilization has never actually observed a real-time decomposition of the material. Instead, scientists use respirometry tests in which materials are placed in aerated soil filled with microbes, and then measure the CO2 the microbes produce as they break down the material. If it's an organic substance like food waste, CO2 levels rise, and that gives scientists an estimate of its decomposition rate. But plastic bags donâ\x80\x99t result in any CO2 production, meaning microbes are not eating themâ\x80\x94the bags are just sitting there, defiantly intact.

Making bags requires fossil fuelsâ\x80\x94by one estimate, 12 million barrels of oil annually. And once a bag ends its useful life in the hands of consumers, it can enter the wildlife food web. Animals like birds and fish eat the plastic, which accumulates along the food chain.', 'While limiting use of plastic bags is a good idea, grabbing a cloth bag may not be the planet-saving habit you think it is.

135,10 Surprising Facts About Rogue Waves,"['oceans', 'How on Earth', 'science']","['Rogue waves, also known as freak waves or monster waves, have long captured the attention of sailors and sea enthusiastsâ\x80\x94and in recent decades, marine scientists. These massive, towering waves seemingly appear out of nowhere, posing a significant threat to ships, offshore structures, and people in their path. Read on to learn more about these fascinating natural occurrences.', 'Rogue waves are extremely large and powerful waves that appear suddenly in open water, surpassing the average height of the tallest surrounding waves by at least double. While there is no universally accepted height threshold to qualify as a rogue wave, they have been observed ranging from 26 feet to as tall as 100 feet. These bodies of water are characterized by their steepness, sharp crests, and immense destructive power, making them objects of both fear and fascination.', 'Several factors contribute to the formation of rogue waves. The convergence of multiple wave systems is one key element: When waves with different wavelengths (space between their crests) and amplitudes (the height from trough to crest) meet, they can combine and reinforce each other, resulting in a sudden increase in wave height and power. Other factors include strong ocean currents, changing wind patterns, and the presence of underwater topographical features such as reefs or deep channels, which can concentrate waves in a specific area. Even considering these known causes, rogue waves are still rare and unpredictable.', 'Although rogue waves can cause devastating effects similar to tidal waves and tsunamis, each type of wave has distinct characteristics and causes. Tidal waves result from the gravitational interactions between Earth, the moon, and the sun, which cause sudden rushes of water up rivers or narrow bays during certain tidal conditions. Tsunamis, on the other hand, are caused by undersea earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides, generating incredibly powerful and far-reaching waves.', 'Modern ships and offshore structures like oil rigs are constructed to withstand expected conditions at sea, which include maximum wave heights of 15 meters (about 50 feet). Yet rogue waves typically surpass these heights and cause major damage. One colossal wave crashed over a cruise ship called the Viking Polaris on a trip to Antarctica in December 2022, killing one passenger and injuring four, in addition to breaking windows and other parts of the vessel. Rogue waves have also caused other freak accidents worldwide.', 'Once considered rare and mythical in maritime lore, rogue waves have emerged as more frequent phenomena than previously believed, with estimates suggesting that one in every 10,000 waves is rogue. A 2019 study analyzing 22 years of measurements gathered by wave buoys also found an increase in the wavesâ\x80\x99 height between 1994 and 2016. But efforts to understand and forecast these waves are hindered by the limited data and the wavesâ\x80\x99 unpredictable nature.', 'Rogue waves have the potential to appear in oceans and large bodies of water worldwide, but certain locations have a higher likelihood of encountering them. Off the southeast coast of South Africa where the Agulhas current flows is one; the North Atlantic Ocean, where the powerful Gulf Stream and other major ocean currents converge, is also notorious for birthing these colossal waves. Parts of the South Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans have witnessed their fair share of rogue wave incidents as well.', 'Rogue waves are mainly connected with oceans and seas, but they can surprise us by appearing inland. In one famous example, a rogue wave may have caused the tragic shipwreck of the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in 1975. The massive cargo ship disappeared from radar during a gale and sank off Whitefish Point, Michigan. All 29 crew members were lost.', 'Though scientists lack hard data about rogue waves prior to the mid-1990s, some researchers have attributed historical shipwrecks to them in hindsight. One theory for the mysterious disappearance of the U.S.S. Cyclops in 1918 is that a rogue wave or an unexpected, severe storm fractured the vessel and its heavy cargo of manganese ore dragged the ship to the oceanâ\x80\x99s depths. In 1974, the Norwegian tanker Wilstar sustained structural damage (but didnâ\x80\x99t sink) likely caused by a rogue wave, while in 1978, German freighter M.S. MÃ¼nchen transmitted a distress signal reporting that a colossal wave had struck the ship. No one survived. A rogue wave is also thought to have smashed the swordfish boat Andrea Gail in the North Atlantic in 1991, chronicled in Sebastian Jungerâ\x80\x99s bestseller The Perfect Storm.', 'Modern cruise ships have not been immune to damage, either. The Bremen and Caledonian Star had their bridge windows shattered by waves in the South Atlantic estimated to be 98 feet (30 meters) tall. The incidents occurred just days apart in 2001. The Holland America cruise ship M.S. Prinsendam also faced two 39-foot (12-meter) rogue waves near Cape Horn in 2007 [PDF], resulting in numerous injuries and medical evacuations.', 'On January 1, 1995, an extraordinary event took place on the Draupner oil-drilling platform situated about 100 miles off the Norwegian coast. The platform had a device called a sea surface elevation probe that recorded a massive wave of 85 feet (26 meters) crashing into the structure. Thanks to this instrument, the Draupner wave holds the distinction of being the first rogue wave ever recorded and confirming the existence of the long-rumored freak occurrences.', 'Under the Wave off Kanagawa, the famous woodblock print by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, portrays a towering wave with boats in the foreground and a tiny Mount Fuji in the distance. Though viewers often mistake the wave for a tsunami, historians and scientists have suggested that the print depicts a rogue wave because it appears to be driven by wind rather than an earthquake.', 'A rogue wave also starred in 1972 disaster flick The Poseidon Adventure, though the captain and crew on the S.S. Poseidonâ\x80\x99s bridge incorrectly cites the waveâ\x80\x99s cause as an underwater earthquake. In the 2005 remake Poseidon, the oversight is corrected and a crew member just feels like â\x80\x9csomethingâ\x80\x99s offâ\x80\x9d before the wave slams the ship.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/rogue-wave-facts

137,Leqembi: What to Know About the New Alzheimer's Drug That Just Received FDA Approval,"['live smarter', 'brain', 'drugs', 'news', 'health']","['As a neurological diagnosis, Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s is bad news. The degenerative illness affects memory, recognition, and cognitive functioning, with dementia being the best-known symptom. More than 6 million Americans live with Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s, which has no cure and few treatments.', 'Leqembi, a new drug purported to slow progression of cognitive impairment, has gotten full FDA approval. But, as The New York Times reports, some health care experts are concerned that the risks outweigh the benefits. Hereâ\x80\x99s what we know so far.', ""Leqembi is a monoclonal drug developed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai and marketed by Biogen. The drug targets and clears out the amyloid beta proteins in the brain that create amyloid plaque, a hallmark of the disease. About 1.5 million people in the U.S. with early-stage Alzheimer's disease could be eligible (Leqembi is not recommended for those with moderate to severe Alzheimer's)."", 'In a clinical trial of people with mild cognitive impairment, Leqembi slowed cognitive decline in those taking the drug compared to those who received a placeboâ\x80\x94roughly a 27 percent reduction in the rate of disease progression over an 18-month period. Subjects on Leqembi scored roughly a half-point better on an 18-point cognitive test than those who were not taking the drug.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s possible Leqembi will allow for those with Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s to stave off cognitive impairment for a longer period of time (five months over the 18-month term of treatment) than those not taking the drug. Someone might retain memory of a phone number or name for longer, for example. But for others, the difference may not be that noticeable.', 'Leqembi is intended for individuals with mild symptoms and in the beginning stages of Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s who have been tested for elevated amyloid protein. Its effect on those with moderate to advanced Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s has not yet been evaluated. Eisai recommends patients stop taking Leqembi once they progress to a moderate stage of the disease.', 'Leqembi is not an oral medication. Itâ\x80\x99s an intravenous drug administered through IV injection twice a month.', 'No, Leqembi cannot cure Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s. It is a treatment intended for those in the early stages of the disease.', 'Yes. Leqembi was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 under its Accelerated Approval program, which permits the use of a drug for a serious condition if a benefit is likely but as yet unproven. The FDA then mandates a clinical trial to confirm that benefit. Leqembi was given full FDA approval in July 2023.', 'While a new treatment for Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s is cause for enthusiasm, there are some very significant risks associated with the drug. The most concerning is the potential for brain swelling or brain bleeds in patients, which may or may not be symptomatic. Roughly 13 percent of trial participants experienced brain swelling; 17 percent experienced brain bleeds. These symptoms were also observed in participants taking the placebo, though at lower rates: 2 percent for swelling, and 9 percent for bleeding. The risk was higher among patients taking anticoagulant medications or those with the APOE4 gene mutation. Between 15 and 25 percent of people in the U.S. carry the mutation.', 'The FDA has included a notice with the drug that warns of these potentially fatal side effects. In their statement announcing approval of Leqembi, the agency added that:', 'â\x80\x9cThe most common side effects of Leqembi were headache, infusion-related reactions, and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a side effect known to occur with the class of antibodies targeting amyloid.Â\xa0ARIA most commonly presents as temporary swelling in areas of the brain seen on imaging studies that usually resolves over time and may be accompanied by small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain. Although ARIA is often not associated with any symptoms, symptoms can occur and include headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes and nausea. ARIA can also infrequently present with serious and life-threatening brain edema that can be associated with seizures and other severe neurological symptoms. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in patients treated with this class of medications and can be fatal.â\x80\x9d', 'Leqembi is an expensive drug. A yearâ\x80\x99s worth of treatment is $26,500, though Medicare will cover about 80 percent of the cost for eligible patients.

139,13 Facts About Opossums,"['animal behavior', 'animal defenses', 'animals', 'biology', 'news', 'science']","['Opossums, which include the roughly 100 species in the order Didelphimorphia, are some of the most misunderstood animals in the Americas. Theyâ\x80\x99re often thought of as dimwitted, dirty creatures whose most impressive trick is acting like roadkill. ', 'The truth is just the opposite: Opossums are smarter, cleaner, and more beneficial to people than many of their woodland comrades. Read on for more interesting facts about opossums.', 'In North America, opossum and possum describe the same animal, but in Australia the word possum refers to a completely different order of organisms. Among the bestknown of their respective types are the Virginia opossum and the brushtail possum. Both are small- to medium-sized, omnivorous marsupials, but the similarities end there. The possum looks like a cute cross between a squirrel and a chinchilla, and it belongs to a different order than the North American mammal that shares (most of) its name. ', 'Despite the potential for confusion, possum is accepted as the shortened version of opossum in this part of the world (and if you see the word possum in this list, you can assume itâ\x80\x99s referring to the animal from the Americas).', 'Marsupialsâ\x80\x94mammals that carry and nurse their young in pouchesâ\x80\x94are absent from much of the world, and in Canada and the United States, the Virginia opossum (Didelphia virginiana) is the sole representative of the group. ', 'Like other marsupials, mother possums give birth to tiny, underdeveloped offspring (called joeys) that immediately crawl into a pouch where they live and nurse during their first months of life. Only once theyâ\x80\x99ve grown big and strong enough do they venture out, transitioning between their motherâ\x80\x99s back and the warmth of the pouch until they mature into adults.', 'Perhaps the most famous characteristic of the opossum is its tendency to play dead in front of predators. When the animal experiences intense fear in the face of danger, it seizes up and flops to the ground where it can remain for hours staring blankly ahead and sticking out its tongue. ', 'Itâ\x80\x99s an impressive defensive mechanism, but its effectiveness canâ\x80\x99t be chalked up to the possumâ\x80\x99s acting skills. Possums have no control over when they play dead or for how long they do it: The comatose-like state is an involuntary reaction triggered by stress.', 'A picture of a possum playing dead doesnâ\x80\x99t really do it justice. To get the full experience, you need to be standing over to it to smell the putrid odor it emits when pretending to be a corpse. Along with its body going limp, one will appear to stop breathing, discharge its bowels, and release a pungent aroma into the air. ', 'The smelly substance it secretes from its anus is just one more reason for natural predators like foxes and bobcats to look for their dinner elsewhere.', 'Even if possums arenâ\x80\x99t the cutest creatures in the forest, they should be a welcome addition to your backyard. Unlike other mammals that carry ticks, which may spread Lyme disease, possums gobble up about 90 percent of the ticks that attach to them. ', 'According to the National Wildlife Federation, a single possum consumes 5000 of the parasites per tick season. That means the more possums that are in your area, the fewer ticks youâ\x80\x99ll likely encounter.', 'Opossums have impressive memoriesâ\x80\x94at least when it comes to food. Researchers found that possums are better at remembering which runway led to a tasty treat than cats, dogs, and even rats. They can also recall the smell of toxic substances up to a year after trying them.', 'While most animals look at a snake and see danger, a possum sees its next meal. The animals are immune to the venom of nearly every type of snake found in their native range (including rattlesnakes), the one exception being the coral snake. Possums take advantage of this by chowing down on snakes on a regular basis.', 'Researchers have been trying to harvest possumsâ\x80\x99 anti-venom powers for decades. Back in 2015, a team of scientists made progress on this front when they recreated a peptide found in possums and and found that mice given the peptide and rattlesnake venom were successfully protected from the venomâ\x80\x99s harmful effects.', ""While possums arenâ\x80\x99t totally immune to rabies (a few cases have been documented), finding a specimen with the disease is extremely unlikely. Marsupials, like possums, have a lower body temperature than the placental mammals that dominate North Americaâ\x80\x94in other words, their bodies aren't suited to the rabies virus."", 'Opossums have prehensile tails. These appendages are sometimes used as an extra arm: They can carry grass and leaves for building nests or grip the sides of trees to provide extra stability while climbing. ', 'Baby possums can even use their tails to hang from branches upside down, as theyâ\x80\x99re often depicted doing in cartoons. But itâ\x80\x99s a myth that possums sleep this way: Their tails are only strong enough to hold them for a short amount of time.', 'Thanks to their whole acting-and-smelling-like-a-corpse routine, opossums arenâ\x80\x99t known as the most sanitary animals in nature. But they take cleanliness seriously: According to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, possumsâ\x80\x94like house catsâ\x80\x94use their tongues and paws to groom themselves frequently and thoroughly. ', 'Possums largely lack sweat glands, so grooming is believed to help them cool down. It also has the added effect of rendering them odorless (when theyâ\x80\x99re not secreting stinky predator repellent, that is).', 'One of the opossumâ\x80\x99s most recognizable features is its opaque eyes. Opossum eyes do have whites and irises, but because their pupils are so large, their eyes appear completely black from a distance. The exaggerated pupil dilation is thought to help the nocturnal animals see better after the sun goes down.', 'It was long assumed that opossums like to keep to themselves, but a 2015 study published in the journal Biology Letters suggests they have a social side. ', 'Researchers at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil, observed some possums in captivity sharing dens even if they werenâ\x80\x99t mates. In one case, 13 white-eared opossums of various age groups were cohabiting the same space. The scientists suspect that male and female possums living in the wild may even build nests together as a way to trigger the femaleâ\x80\x99s reproductive hormones.', 'The way it gives birth and raises its young isnâ\x80\x99t the only thing thatâ\x80\x99s interesting about the opossumâ\x80\x99s reproductive life. Females have two vaginal tracts and two uteri, and males in turn have a forked or bifurcated penis. ', 'This is fairly typical for marsupials, but when European colonizers first landed in North America centuries ago, they didnâ\x80\x99t know what to make of the confusing genitalia.

So why would it matter which side of the popcorn bag is facing up?', 'Because of whatâ\x80\x99s called a susceptor, which is basically a metallic patch that absorbs the microwave energy and converts it to heat. Microwave popcornâ\x80\x99s susceptors often go unnoticed, because theyâ\x80\x99re inside the bags. But you may recognize a susceptorâ\x80\x99s characteristic silver coating from other microwaveable productsâ\x80\x94like Hot Pockets, whose susceptors are known as crisping sleeves.', 'When a popcorn bag is placed in the microwave with the correct side up, the susceptor is on the bottomâ\x80\x94and so are the kernels, meaning theyâ\x80\x99ll heat up and pop faster. In the words of artisanal popcorn brand Kettle Heroes, â\x80\x9cPositioning the kernels over the susceptor maximizes the popping. The amount of popped kernels in your bag of popcorn will be somewhat reduced if you turn the bag upside down, but that wonâ\x80\x99t affect the taste.â\x80\x9d', 'YouTubers TKOR and Mad Scientist both tried microwaving popcorn with the wrong side of the bag facing up and didnâ\x80\x99t see any meaningful difference in the results. Food writer Kimberly Holland, on the other hand, did feel like the upside-down bag underperformed its â\x80\x9cThis Side Upâ\x80\x9d counterpart. â\x80\x9cI found it took a few seconds longer for the kernels to start popping. The bag was less full at the end of the popping time,â\x80\x9d she wrote for Allrecipes. â\x80\x9cAlso, the upside-down bag never reached a rolling popping cadence.

141,What Happens if You Put Diesel Fuel in a Gas-Powered Car?,"['cars', 'live smarter', 'mf explains it all']","['It can happen to anyone. Maybe you were distracted by a text message or phone call or someone else pulling up at the pump. You grabbed the wrong handle, and now your gas tank is loaded with diesel fuelâ\x80\x94a simple mistake that can cost you big-time.', 'The issue is combustion. Gasoline-powered cars have engines that run on a combination of liquid fuel and ordinary air, which are mixed together inside the vehicle and make their way to a cylinder block, where the fuel-air mix is compressed by pistons. A spark ignites the substance in a small, contained explosion; the gas produced as a result pushes back against the pistons, forcing them down and generating the power necessary to keep the car running. ', 'But these engines canâ\x80\x99t combust diesel. Unlike gasoline, diesel doesnâ\x80\x99t readily mix with air unless certain conditions are met. While gasoline can evaporate at room temperature, diesel must be exposed to intense heat to follow suit. Diesel engines work by spraying the fuel into a cylinder thatâ\x80\x99s already filled with high-temperature compressed air, which makes the diesel itself combust spontaneouslyâ\x80\x94no spark required. Gasoline engines canâ\x80\x99t provide diesel with the temperatures it needs to combust, and, because itâ\x80\x99s unable to evaporate sufficiently, diesel wonâ\x80\x99t ignite when the spark is released.', 'To those who drive gas-powered vehicles, diesel is useless. Ideally, you realized your mistake at the gas station before the car was even startedâ\x80\x94but if not, as soon as the last drops of gasoline in the car, truck, or motorcycleâ\x80\x99s system are gone, the vehicle will shut down, leaving you stranded. And because gas-powered rides arenâ\x80\x99t able to process the fuel, the diesel has to be removed manuallyâ\x80\x94a process that isnâ\x80\x99t cheap.', 'First, youâ\x80\x99ll need to call a tow truck; then itâ\x80\x99s time to enlist a skilled car mechanic. Depending on how much of the liquid youâ\x80\x99ve poured into the tank, thereâ\x80\x99s a good to fair chance that some of it made its way into the carâ\x80\x99s fuel line. Your mechanic will probably have no choice but to drain the entire fuel system, which can set you back $500 to $1000.', 'Gas stations try to stop their customers from making this mistake in the first place. Often, the nozzles on diesel pumps are designed to be too wide to slot into most gas tanks. Also, at many locales, these pumps are colored bright green, yellow, or orange, which makes them more conspicuous and serves as a visual reminder that they are not, in fact, gasoline dispensers. However, there isnâ\x80\x99t a universal chromatic system. A few companiesâ\x80\x94like BPâ\x80\x94use green-tipped pumps on their gas dispensers.

There was never just silence.', 'According to Dr. Zaid Yusufi Rafin, the psychiatrist that reported the case [PDF], it was a rare long-term manifestation of a pernicious earwormâ\x80\x94a tune that gets stuck in your mind without your wanting it to. The student was able to reduce his earworms with cognitive-behavioral therapy, but short of a visit to the doctor, what can the rest of us do to rid ourselves of them? Here are five strategies, backed by science.', 'Earworms tend to be small fragments of music that repeat over and over (often a songâ\x80\x99s refrain or chorus). A 2014 study evaluated existing surveys of peopleâ\x80\x99s methods for coping with earworms and found that one of the most effective behaviors is just listening to the whole tune. Participants said they actively engaged with the offending music: They hummed or sang it, figured out the tuneâ\x80\x99s title and the name of the singer, or listened to the full song instead of the unwanted snippet. Some people listened to other music immediately after the ending of the earworm-generating tune as well.', 'The same study also found that some subjects used competing songs, or â\x80\x9ccure tunes,â\x80\x9d to control their earworms. The researchers identified 64 such tunes, with six of them named by more than one person: â\x80\x9cHappy Birthday to You,â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cGod Save the Queenâ\x80\x9d (the participants in the survey were British), The A-Team theme, â\x80\x9cSledgehammerâ\x80\x9d by Peter Gabriel, â\x80\x9cKashmirâ\x80\x9d by Led Zeppelin (above), and â\x80\x9cKarma Chameleonâ\x80\x9d by Culture Club. In most cases, the cure tunes suppressed the earworms without becoming earworms themselves. On the rare occasions when they did, people said that they preferred to have the cure tunes stuck in their heads.', 'Our brains are incapable of paying attention to more than one thing at a time, so any attempts to multitask are neurally doomed to failure. This limitation can be helpful when it comes to earworms. Strategies involving words, rather than music, can help nudge your brain away from the earworms and toward something else. Some effective remedies include talking with other people, meditation, prayer, watching TV, and reading.', 'In a 2015 study, researchers suspected that the act of chewing gum might interfere with the formation of the auditory imagery needed to experience an earworm. How? Chewing might hinder the motor programming involved in speech articulation, and therefore could keep people from subvocalizing (saying the words to the songs in their heads). They found that vigorous gum-chewing did reduce the number of unwanted musical thoughts, but noted that not just any kind of motor activity leads to earworm reduction. When the study participants tapped their fingers upon the desk, they had more persistent earworms than when they chewed gum.', 'Despite earwormsâ\x80\x99 involuntary and intrusive nature, research indicates that people actually donâ\x80\x99t mind them that much. A daily diary study concluded that only a small percentage of earworms interfered with daily activities, and other research has found links between earworms and feelings of wellbeing, both before and while experiencing the inner tunes. Another study found that earworms occur more frequently for liked than for disliked songs. For most people, earworms donâ\x80\x99t play for very long.

The seemingly ordinary adjective inspires an excessive outpouring of ire. Why?', 'A group of psychologists decided to find out. Researchers from Oberlin College in Ohio and Trinity University in San Antonio ran three different experiments [PDF] to figure out how many people really find the word moistÂ\xa0disdainful, and why. They found that around 20 percent of the population studied was averse to the word, but that it didnâ\x80\x99t have anything to do with the way it sounds. Rather, itâ\x80\x99s the association with bodily functions that seem to turn most people off, whether they realize it or not.', 'Most of the participants who told the researchers they hated the word chalked it up to phonics. â\x80\x9cIt just has an ugly sound that makes whatever youâ\x80\x99re talking about sound gross,â\x80\x9d one participant argued. However, people did not show similar aversions to words that utilize the same sounds, such as foist or rejoiced. People found the word moist most disgusting when it was accompanied by unrelated, positive words like paradise, or when it was accompanied by sexual words. By contrast, when it accompanied food words (like cake), people werenâ\x80\x99t as bothered by it.', ""The younger and more neurotic the study participants were, the more likely they were to dislike the word. Additionally, the more disgust they associated with bodily functions, the less they liked moist.

', 'In 2001, researchers at the University of Bologna decided to examine the phenomenon. In a paper published in European Psychologist, the authors cited earlier papers in which canting could be interpreted as a submissive expression or as a way of signaling complacency. The researchers wanted to see how often it was done, and how people responded.', 'In the study, 51 women and 28 men were recruited from the university, brought into a room, and told that photos would be taken (but not the real reason why). The researchers then left the room and took photos remotely. Of the 79 people photographed, a total of 55, or 71 percent, tilted their head either toward the right or left without being prompted. Only one-third kept a neutral, stiff-necked posture.', 'The researchers then asked participants to assess both their own attractiveness and that of others using the still photos taken. Images in which head canting appeared scored higher than non-canting photos.', 'Clearly, canting can be interpreted positively by the viewer. Perhaps itâ\x80\x99s seen as friendlier, or less threatening. But is that why we do it? The authors of the study posit that head canting could be reflexive in light of discomfort at having oneâ\x80\x99s photo taken.', 'But itâ\x80\x99s not true of photos alone. A 2001 paper in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior examined 1498 paintings featuring human figures completed between the 14th and 20th centuries and noted head canting appeared in virtually half of them. Tellingly, the canting was most common in depictions of younger people than older ones, and virtually absent when a painting depicted a noble or royal. And  in a 2016 analysis, depictions of robots who were canting their heads were perceived to be more likeable and less frightening than robots with rigid poses. Both lend credence to the theory that it might be construed as a submissive posture.', 'Some head canting is intentional. Professional photographers advise subjects to tilt their head, believing it might accentuate a personâ\x80\x99s jawline or tighten skin. Whether we do it for that reason or to signal a certain amount of agreeability is hard to prove scientifically, but itâ\x80\x99s certainly part of the communication between a photographer and the subject.

But if you have a phobia of sharksâ\x80\x94known as galeophobiaâ\x80\x94you might feel that fear whenever you even just see a video of a shark. Your galeophobia could keep you from going to the beach or visiting an aquarium (which almost never have great whites in captivity, though they do play host to other shark species).', 'All phobias are technically anxiety disorders, so it makes sense that fear differs from anxiety much in the same way that it differs from phobia. As the APA explains, fear is â\x80\x9can appropriate short-term response to a present, clearly identifiable threat,â\x80\x9d while anxiety â\x80\x9cis a future-oriented, long-term response focused on a diffuse threat.â\x80\x9d Fear is a reaction to the shark swimming toward you; an anxiety disorder is that reaction to sharks in general.', 'Not all anxiety is a sign of an anxiety disorder. â\x80\x9cAnxiety in itself is not bad. Normal levels of anxiety lie on one end of a spectrum and may present as low levels of fear or apprehension, mild sensations of muscle tightness and sweating, or doubts about your ability to complete a task,â\x80\x9d psychologist Luana Marques writes for Harvard Health Blog.', 'If youâ\x80\x99re experiencing such severe and frequent anxiety that itâ\x80\x99s interfering with your everyday life, though, then itâ\x80\x99s probably a good idea to discuss it with your healthcare provider. If the anxiety is specific to one thingâ\x80\x94sharks, insects, heights, public speaking, small spaces, etc.â\x80\x94you might have a phobia. But there are plenty of other kinds of anxiety disorders, too. ', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/fear-vs-phobia-whats-the-difference

The stars are filled with different combinations of metal salts that each add a bright color to the firework when it explodes.', 'Different chemical elements correspond with different colors: strontium carbonate for red, calcium chloride for orange, sodium nitrate for yellow, barium chloride for green, and copper chloride for blue. Purple fireworks are created much like you might create purple paintâ\x80\x94by mixing red and blue.', 'LiveScience explains that when you light the fuse on the outside of the fireworksâ\x80\x99s thick tube, the flame ignites a pouch of black powder inside known as the lift charge, which causes the shell containing the stars to catapult into the air. As it rises, a time-delay fuse begins to burn within it and, by the time it reaches its maximum height, the shell bursts, causing the stars inside to color each strand of the explosion.', 'Paul Nicholas Worsey, fireworks expert and professor of mining and nuclear engineering at the University of Missouri at Rolla, told LiveScience that red and green are the easiest colors to create, while blue is more difficult. Worsey says gold is best if you want your firework to keep its color for a long time, maybe even until it hits the ground.', 'The trick behind those especially crowd-pleasing fireworks that change color after they explode is simple: The stars are coated in multiple metal salts.

One of those eggs held a surprise: a stillborn female baby crocodile. DNA testing confirmed it was a 99.9 percent match to the mother.', 'Parthenogenesis occurs when chromosome-filled polar bodies that typically disappear instead fuse with the egg, providing the necessary recipe for offspring in the absence of sperm. Though rare, parthenogenesis does occur and may persist when species need to reproduce in the absence of a mate to guarantee its survival.', 'But that may not be the whole story. When two California condors reproduced in captivity in 2021, they experienced parthenogenesis even though they were housed with males. Parthenogenesis occurred even though it wasnâ\x80\x99t strictly necessary.', 'The discovery in crocodiles is intriguing in and of itself, but it also opens up the possibility that dinosaurs might have also been capable of the same biological trick.', 'The crocodile joins a small but eclectic group including snakes, lizards, and sharks that have demonstrated the ability.

Linguistics (the scientific study of language) has answers, and can give us insight into how to use the words we want to useâ\x80\x94and the techniques are surprisingly similar to how we learn new languages.', 'As Schoolhouse Rock taught us, pronouns are words like we, you, and it that stand in for longer names or phrases. Pronouns, along with articles and prepositions, are part of a larger class of words called â\x80\x9cfunction wordsâ\x80\x9d that our brains process mostly unconsciously, both because theyâ\x80\x99re so frequent and because they hold the structure of sentences together. On the opposite end are content wordsâ\x80\x94parts of speech like nouns, verbs, and adjectivesâ\x80\x94which hold more attention because they deliver information.', 'Living languages are always changing, thanks in part to the fact that theyâ\x80\x99re constantly picking up new content words (like cheugy or rizz). But languages can go decades between picking up new function words; when they do enter a language, they tend to come in one at a time, and catch on much more slowly.', 'This is why the majority of people donâ\x80\x99t learn many new pronouns (or other function words, for that matter)â\x80\x94there simply arenâ\x80\x99t a lot out there, and because of that, your brain doesnâ\x80\x99t get to practice learning new ones, meaning theyâ\x80\x99re harder to learn. Itâ\x80\x99s a self-perpetuating cycle.', 'And thatâ\x80\x99s not the only challenge with function words: The fact that theyâ\x80\x99re so automatic is why many people donâ\x80\x99t even notice pronoun slips. There are also way more function words than content wordsâ\x80\x94if you add up all the pronouns you say or hear in a single day, youâ\x80\x99ll be shocked at how much more you use them than other common words. Because the brain tends to filter out very frequent things from your conscious awareness, function words are almost invisible to us unless weâ\x80\x99re paying attention to them intentionally; there are even viral brain teasers showing how good our brains are at ignoring function words.', 'All of this means that there are lots of chances to mess up pronouns every day, without you even noticing. If youâ\x80\x99re trying to use a new set of pronouns about someoneâ\x80\x94your friend whoâ\x80\x99s switching from they/them to she/her, for exampleâ\x80\x94you have to overcome a very strong force of habit, because youâ\x80\x99ve probably said â\x80\x9ctheyâ\x80\x9d a lot. You have tons of practice with the old form, which gives you a kind of automatic muscle memory. Overriding that habit takes intentional effort and attention.', 'Are we doomed, then, to constantly embarrass ourselves by messing up pronouns forever? Nopeâ\x80\x94all the linguistic science about function words can be used to strengthen our language brains.', 'The first step is simply to practice cultivating linguistic awareness: Try slowing down and paying attention to function words in your own and othersâ\x80\x99 language, just to get your brain used to actually noticing them.', 'Rewiring the way your brain does pronouns (or any function word) is very similar to second-language learning strategies. In addition to cultivating linguistic awareness, you should focus on repetition, reinforcement, and real-world practice. ', 'You can get repetition and reinforcement by writing a story about your friend to practice her new pronouns, or you can get reinforcement and real-world practice by chatting with a mutual friend who can help correct you if you slip up. Positive reinforcement is just as important, tooâ\x80\x94having a â\x80\x9creverse swear jarâ\x80\x9d where you give yourself a nickel every time you get the new pronouns right can be a great way to solidify the pattern (and improve your linguistic awareness).Â\xa0Â\xa0', 'If you want to practice some pronouns that are completely new to you, you can change your petâ\x80\x99s pronouns to (for example) xe/xyr to get more repetition and real-world practice.

Having a plan of what to say can reduce the feeling of anxiety that can make us defensive or avoidant. A short â\x80\x9cshoot, sorry, I meantâ\x80\x93â\x80\x9d can be perfectly appropriate, and correcting yourself helps reinforce the linguistic pattern youâ\x80\x99re trying to learnâ\x80\x94win/win!', 'If youâ\x80\x99ve struggled with pronouns, youâ\x80\x99re not aloneâ\x80\x94itâ\x80\x99s a direct consequence of the way our brains do language.

Read on for the answers to those questions and more.', 'Sand, by definition, consists of tiny, loose grains of material that are larger than silt but smaller than gravel. Much of the sand on beaches is made of eroded rock, like sandstone, but it can also be made of crushed seashells, parrotfish poop (which is actually very small bits ofÂ\xa0undigested coral skeleton), or the remains of calcium-containing sea creatures called foraminifera.Â\xa0', 'Sand can even be composed of crystals.

But glass is only one type of material made from sand.', 'Sand is also an essential ingredient in metal casting, water filtration, ceramic glazes, paint coatings, and even as a base for detergents and adhesives. But the biggest guzzler of sand is the construction industry. Basic building elements from mortar and stucco to concrete are all created with sand.

Both Egyptian medical papyri and Hippocrates, lauded as the father of medicine, suggested that a person who suspected they might be pregnant insert an onion or other strong-smelling bulbous vegetable into their vagina overnight. If the personâ\x80\x99s breath smelled of onions the next morning, they werenâ\x80\x99t pregnant; this was based on the idea that if the womb was open, and wafting the oniony scent up to the mouth like a wind tunnel, there was no fetus. If the person were pregnant, then the womb would be closed, so no wind tunnel.', 'From The Distaff Gospels, a collection of womenâ\x80\x99s medical lore written in the late 15th century: â\x80\x9cMy friends, if you want to know if a woman is pregnant, you must ask her to pee in a basin and then put a latch or a key in it, but it is better to use a latchâ\x80\x94leave this latch in the basin with the urine for three or four hours. Then throw the urine away and remove the latch. If you see the impression of the latch on the basin, be sure that the woman is pregnant. If not, she is not pregnant.â\x80\x9d Say what now?', 'As bizarre as the â\x80\x9clatch testâ\x80\x9d sounds, it still recognized that something in a pregnant personâ\x80\x99s pee was different than non-pregnant urine, a fact that 16th-century European â\x80\x9cpiss prophetsâ\x80\x9d also recognized. These so-called experts claimed they could determine whether or not a person was with child by the color and characteristics of their urine. Some also mixed urine with wine and observed the results, a test that might have seen some success, given that alcohol can react to proteins present in a pregnant personâ\x80\x99s pee. Of course, these piss prophets didnâ\x80\x99t limit their divination to pregnant people; they could also, by examining urine, intuit whether the urineâ\x80\x99s owner was suffering from any illness or disease.', 'One 16th-century physician, Jacques Guillemeau, claimed you could tell by a personâ\x80\x99s eyes whether they were pregnant. Guillemeau, author of an influential treatise on ophthalmology, claimed that as early as the second month, â\x80\x9ca pregnant woman gets deep-set eyes with small pupils, drooping lids and swollen little veins in the corner of the eye.â\x80\x9d That is likely not true, but he was right about one thing: Eyes can change during pregnancy, affecting your vision. This is why itâ\x80\x99s not a good idea to get new contacts or prescription glasses during pregnancy.', 'Early on in pregnancy, at roughly six to eight weeks, the cervix, labia, and vagina can take on a dark bluish or purple-red hue, owing to the increased blood flow to the area. This remarkable indication of pregnancy was first noticed in 1836 by a French physician. It later became known as Chadwickâ\x80\x99s sign, after James Read Chadwick, an obstetrics doctor who brought the discovery up at a meeting of the American Gynecological Society in 1886. ', 'Aside from observational tests such as Chadwickâ\x80\x99s sign, pregnancy tests were still an unpleasant crapshoot until the 20th century. Investigation into hormones, the big thing in science at the turn of the century, just made pregnancy testing unpleasant for a bunch of rabbits, mice, and rats.', 'In the 1920s, two German scientists, Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek, determined that there was a specific hormone present in the urine of pregnant people that seemed to be linked to ovary growth; we now know it as human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG. They figured this out by injecting the urine of pregnant people into sexually immature rabbits, rats, and mice, which would induce ovarian development. Most of the time, the pregnant personâ\x80\x99s pee would produce bulging masses on the animalsâ\x80\x99 ovaries, a sure indication of the presence of hCG. So, the Rabbit Test was born.', 'According to a contemporary medical journal, it worked like this: A sample of urine was injected into a group of young female mice over a period of five days. On the fifth day, the mice were killed and autopsied to examine the state of their ovaries. If their reproductive bits looked excited, the test was positive. If you wanted your results in less than five days, they could simply use more mice.', 'This method ran through a lot of rabbits, mice, and rats; though the phrase â\x80\x9cthe rabbit diedâ\x80\x9d popularly meant that the woman was pregnant, in actuality, all of the rabbitsâ\x80\x94and the mice and ratsâ\x80\x94died. Though doctors could look at the ovaries of the animal without killing it, that tended to be too much trouble.', 'Though it worked on the same principle as the Rabbit Test, this one was actually a bit betterâ\x80\x94at least the animal remained alive at the end of it. By the late 1940s, scientists had determined that when a pregnant personâ\x80\x99s pee is injected into a live toad or frog, the unfortunate amphibian will produce eggs within 24 hours. The toad or frog lived to see another day and, usually, another test.

This stops them from making a meal of the soft flesh or laying their eggs inside it.Â\xa0', 'In addition to pest control, peach fuzz doubles as a natural preservative. The same delicate skin and flesh that make peaches susceptible to hungry bugs put them at risk of rot under certain circumstances. Because water fosters bacteria, excess moisture on food can speed up decay. The tiny hairs on peaches delay this by collecting condensation droplets and holding them away from the fruitâ\x80\x99s skin.', 'Unlike much produce sold in the supermarket, modern peaches arenâ\x80\x99t the result of selective breeding. Fossilized pits found in China suggest peaches similar to the ones we eat today were growing without human intervention in the late Pliocene era.

Here, in no particular order, are just a few of historyâ\x80\x99s most influential tomesâ\x80\x94and how they made humanity look at things in a new light.', 'If weâ\x80\x99re going to name influential books, we might as well begin with the oldest dated printed tome. On May 11, 868 CEâ\x80\x94nearly 600 years before Gutenberg ever considered printing a Bibleâ\x80\x94a man named Wang Jie commissioned the printing of The Diamond Sutra, a MahÄ\x81yÄ\x81na Buddhist â\x80\x9cwisdomâ\x80\x9d text presented as a conversation between Buddha and his disciple, Subhuti, in Chinese. According to Susan Whitfield, then-director of the International Dunhuang Project at the British Library, â\x80\x9cPrinting was developed in China by the 8th century, and certainly by the 9th century, when this sutra was made, it was a refined art.â\x80\x9d The 6000-word, nearly 16.5-foot-long scroll was found in 1900 in a secret library along the Silk Road in China; it was later taken to England by archaeologist Marc Aurel Stein. It now resides at the British Library, which calls it â\x80\x9cone of the most influential MahÄ\x81yÄ\x81na scriptures in East Asia.â\x80\x9d', 'Wang Jie commissioned the book, according to Whitfield, because of one of Buddhismâ\x80\x99s most important tenets: To do good deeds. â\x80\x9cOne of the ways of doing a good deed and gaining merit, and also sending out merit into the world for others, is by either copying an image of the Buddha, or by copying his words and transmitting them,â\x80\x9d she explained in a 2007 talk. By unrolling the Sutra to read it, Wang Jie (or whoever possessed the Sutra) would further spread Buddhaâ\x80\x99s teachings. â\x80\x9cThe Buddhists were one of the major groups that propagated and refined and developed printing,â\x80\x9d Whitfield says, â\x80\x9cbecause of the reason that they could realize multiple copies of prayers and other texts and that would be good for their religion.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x94Erin McCarthy', 'From shaping our ideas about what it means to be a teenager to inventing the modern name Jessica, William Shakespeare has shaped modern life in ways both subtle and dramatic. But without the First Folio, many of his most historically and culturally important worksâ\x80\x94including Macbeth, The Taming of the Shrew, Julius Caesar, and The Tempestâ\x80\x94probably would not have survived.', 'First published in 1623 as Mr. William Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies, the First Folio collected 36 of Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s plays, half of which had never appeared in print. (During Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s life, actors who performed his plays didnâ\x80\x99t work from scripts; they were given lengthy parchments containing only the lines they needed to learn.) Of the plays that had been previously published, most existed only as fragile â\x80\x9cquartos.â\x80\x9d The First Folio was compiled and published by Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s friends and colleagues and is almost universally considered the most accurate historical source for his workâ\x80\x94and often hailed as the single most important book of literature ever produced. In October 2020, a copy sold to a private collector for nearly $10 millionâ\x80\x94the highest recorded price ever paid at auction for a literary work.', 'But the First Folio didnâ\x80\x99t just preserve the Bardâ\x80\x99s plays; Shakespeare scholars maintain that it was critical in securing his reputation as an important playwright in the years following the English Civil War. Thanks in part to the First Folio, Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s plays were widely available when English theaters were desperate for material. As a result, his work popularized dramatic conventions, plots, and linguistic devices that would profoundly influence everything from Western literature to Bollywood cinema. â\x80\x94April Snellings', ""The universal themes at the heart of Aesop's Fables have resonated with readers for millennia.

In 2001, it was voted the single greatest work of philosophy ever composed.

But itâ\x80\x99s primarily concerned with defining justice in both societal and personal terms, and proving that a just life is better and more satisfying than an unjust one. To make his point, Plato imagines an ideal state populated by three social classes: one that rules the state, one that guards it, and one that produces all the things the state needs.', 'Besides being the first major work of Western political philosophy and a foundational text of Western thought, Republic has been embraced by a wide range of influential figures throughout history.

Most researchers used a polynomial system in which each organism was given a sometimes-lengthy descriptive name. Besides being unwieldy, polynomial names had no standardized format and were often highly subjective, so one species might have been known by several different names. People went around giving organisms names like Solanum caule inermi herbaceo, foliis pinnatis incises (â\x80\x9csolanum with the smooth stem which is herbaceous and has incised pinnate leaves,â\x80\x9d if your Latin is rusty) and hoping someone would know they were talking about a tomato.', 'With Species Plantarum, Linnaeus showed the world an alternative: binomial nomenclature, which assigned each of the 6000 plants listed in the book a two-word name identifying it by genus and species (the tomato, for example, was dubbed Solanum lycopersicum). Binomial nomenclature was quickly adopted throughout the scientific community; more than 250 years later, weâ\x80\x99re still using it.

But Flanagan notes that itâ\x80\x99s important to look at the Manifesto through its historical context, and to separate the ideas Marx and Engels laid out in their work from how it was understood and used in subsequent centuries.', 'Still, for folks in the modern era, the Manifesto remains prescient given that many societal issues that Marx and Engels identified in it (like class-based inequality) are still ongoing, and because it offersâ\x80\x94whether one fully believes in its ideology or notâ\x80\x94a vision of a different kind of democracy. â\x80\x9cOne of the reasons why the Manifesto matters for [modern-day] activists, but also for others, is that it contains an encapsulation of Marxism,â\x80\x9d Flanagan says. In that way, it serves as â\x80\x9ca primer for activists, and therein, I think lies a lot of the key to its impact. [In] reading the Manifesto, I could imagine an activist feeling like this has a sort of moral clarity and directness thatâ\x80\x99s very appealing.

159,9 Explosive Facts About the Manhattan Project,"['World War II', 'physics', 'history', 'lists']","['During World War II, Americaâ\x80\x99s greatest minds were assembled under the secretive title â\x80\x9cthe Manhattan Projectâ\x80\x9d to create the deadliest weapon the world had ever seenâ\x80\x94an atomic bomb. Their complicated but charismatic leader was J. Robert Oppenheimer, a blue-eyed, rake-thin theoretical physicist who wore a porkpie hat and read Sanskrit.', 'The unlikely story of the atomic bomb and its ambivalent mastermind is coming to the silver screen this July, in Christopher Nolanâ\x80\x99s film Oppenheimer. Brush up on your Manhattan Project knowledge with these nine facts about the twisted path to the nuclear age.', 'In 1938, physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann found that when a neutron with enough energy strikes a â\x80\x9cfissileâ\x80\x9d atom, the atom splinters into pieces, releasing lots of energy and a bunch more neutrons.', 'The energy from a single split atom wonâ\x80\x99t cause an explosion. But if a scientist figured out how to get lots of fissile atoms really close together and then split one, the resulting neutrons would be able to find and split more fissile atoms. This chain reaction would then quickly cascade into a massive burst of energy, causing an explosion.', 'The timing couldnâ\x80\x99t have been worse for such a deadly possibility. While many European physicists fled the Nazi regime, some German scientists had given Hitler a head-start on a potential bomb.', 'The U.S. government realized the urgency of producing a nuclear weapon to counteract it. The Army began what would be called the â\x80\x9cManhattan Projectâ\x80\x9d (since its first offices were in Manhattan), building factories to produce raw materials and recruiting the countryâ\x80\x99s most brilliant physicists to move to a planned laboratory in New Mexico called â\x80\x9cProject Y.â\x80\x9d Major General Leslie Groves, in charge of choosing the scientific team, handpicked Oppenheimer to lead the lab in October 1942.', 'Oppenheimer was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley known for his signature porkpie hat and nonstop chain-smoking. Though a brilliant theorist, â\x80\x9cOppie,â\x80\x9d as everyone called him, had basically no experience working in a lab. And although he was widely respected, some questioned whether he could manage the big personalities on the project, which included as many as 20 current or future Nobel Prize winners.', 'Plus, he just didnâ\x80\x99t seem like the type to head a major military project. Thanks to his paltry weight and chronic cough (from smoking four packs of cigarettes a day), an army physical declared Oppenheimer â\x80\x9cpermanently physically incapacitatedâ\x80\x9d from serving. He had to sign a waiver to begin his post, according to American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (on which Nolanâ\x80\x99s film is based).', 'The military was also concerned about Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s left-wing activism: He was close with several Communist Party members. The Soviet Union was Americaâ\x80\x99s ally, but the FBI considered communists at home to be â\x80\x9cdangerous subversives.â\x80\x9d Still, Groves insisted that Oppenheimer was the man for the job.', 'The tiny town in New Mexico was near Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s summer ranch and was remote enough for the Army to keep its activity secret. They turned the barren desert mesa into a massive laboratory, with housing for families and dormitories for single employees.', 'A work-hard, play-hard culture developed. The six-day workweek usually ended with a party, where Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s famous martinis always flowed (they reportedly hit harder at the siteâ\x80\x99s high altitude). The bachelorsâ\x80\x99 dorm preferred an even stronger concoction: pure laboratory alcohol mixed with pineapple juice and poured over dry ice, according to Bird and Sherwin. At one time, 22-year-old future Nobelist Richard Feynman went around cracking the combinations to locked filing cabinets all over the site. The next morning, bewildered guards found them open with nothing amiss.', 'Simply making the 14 pounds of plutonium required for an atomic bomb took a massive industrial effort. In fact, the Nazi regime mostly gave up on its bomb plans because creating that amount of fissile material seemed impossible. The U.S. Army built several top-secret factories just to produce uranium and turn it into plutonium.', 'Even when they had their baseball-sized hunk of plutonium in hand, the physicists at Los Alamos had to figure out how to compress the ball to half its size so the chain reaction could proceed. They ended up surrounding it with precisely shaped pieces of TNT that would explode together in just the right way to force the ball inward on itself.', 'Oppenheimer and the other physicists, many of whom had ties to the Communist Party or organized labor, were placed under constant surveillance.', 'The governmentâ\x80\x99s fears turned out to be legitimate: before moving to Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was approached by a friend about providing technical intelligence to Soviet agents through a backchannel. Even though he flatly refused, his failure to immediately report the conversation would later become a major scandal.', 'Despite all the security measures, several members of the Manhattan Project spied for the Soviet Union, including two high-ranking physicists at Los Alamos, Theodore Hall and Klaus Fuchs.', 'The Manhattan Project had been sold to the scientists as the U.S.â\x80\x99s only option for defeating a nuclear-armed Nazi Germany. But, by 1944, it was clear that Germany had no bomb and the allies would beat them without the deployment of atomic weapons.', 'Groves shocked several physicists at a dinner that year when he stated that the Soviets were the real target of the program. Many physicists felt the Soviet Union had made tremendous sacrifices to keep victory out of Hitlerâ\x80\x99s hands. Moreover, they believed excluding Russian scientists would only lead to a postwar arms race. Theodore Hall later claimed that this fear was what led him to spy for the Soviets.', 'They argued for the U.S. to show its hand, using the fact that the U.S. had developed an atomic bomb as leverage to end the war with Japan, which had no atomic program. They hoped the revelation of the bombâ\x80\x99s existence would preclude the need to actually use it. But their efforts, which included a petition in July 1945 signed by 70 scientists, never reached the new president, Harry S. Truman.', 'The petition was received by the incoming Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who declined to show it to Truman. Byrnes also sat on the Interim Committee, along with Oppenheimer and other military and scientific leaders, who were appointed by the secretary of war to advise the president on the bombâ\x80\x99s use. When the committee recommended deploying the bomb immediately, Oppenheimer notably failed to convey the staunch opposition felt by so many of the Manhattan Projectâ\x80\x99s scientists. At the time, Oppenheimer felt that the physicists should focus on making the bomb, and let the government decide how to use it.', 'The scientistsâ\x80\x99 concerns had come too late. For years they had worked too hard and fast for reflection, and now that the bomb was almost complete, their voices were ignored.', 'Many of the physicists thought they had successfully lobbied the government to inform the Soviets of the bomb and merely use it as a bargaining chip against Japan.', 'On July 16, 1945, the military successfully detonated an atomic bomb in the New Mexico desertâ\x80\x94the first deployment of a nuclear weapon in history. The Trinity test further convinced its witnesses of their inventionâ\x80\x99s apocalyptic power. Oppenheimer was reminded of the Hindu verse: â\x80\x9cNow I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.â\x80\x9d', 'When atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few weeks later, the news inspired an uncomfortable mix of jubilation and regret at Los Alamos. Some, including Oppenheimer, became increasingly depressed by the destructive outcome of their work. When he first met Truman, he said, â\x80\x9cMr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands.â\x80\x9d', 'The now-famous â\x80\x9cfather of the atomic bombâ\x80\x9d tried to forestall a postwar arms race by pushing for international regulation of atomic weapons and fighting against the development of the hydrogen bomb.', 'The H-bomb harnesses the fission reactionsâ\x80\x99 energy to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction like those that power the sun, creating an explosion thousands of times larger than the atomic bombs used against Japan. Despite Oppenheimerâ\x80\x99s opposition, the bomb was developed and successfully tested in 1952.', 'In 1954, Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance by the Atomic Energy Commission after a hearing on his left-wing associations before the war, orchestrated by his political enemies because of his stance on nuclear weapon non-proliferation.', 'Though the two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only nuclear weapons ever deployed in combat, the U.S. and five other countries conducted more than 2000 nuclear tests after 1945. Over 70 nations signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, outlawing the practice in 1996.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/manhattan-project-oppenheimer-facts

However, you might have noticed by now that all of those plastic plates, cups, and storage containers you put in the dishwasher tend to come out a little different. Instead of being dry by the end, those items are still covered in beads of water. ', 'So what gives? Turns out, itâ\x80\x99s not your dishwasherâ\x80\x99s fault that plasticware never seems to fully dry in the dishwasher. It happens because of science. ', 'According to Compact Appliance, dishwashers get pretty hot, typically between 130Â°F and 170Â°F. Dinnerware made of glass, metal, and ceramic absorbs this heat, which then helps moisture evaporate quickly during the dishwasherâ\x80\x99s dry cycle. But plastic doesnâ\x80\x99t absorb and retain heat the way those other materials do and actually cools down much faster, meaning the moisture on the surface is less likely to evaporate by the time the cycle ends. ', 'In addition, condensation can puddle up on plastic storage containers because theyâ\x80\x99re designed with rims and lips to create a tighter seal for lids. This makes it even tougher for these items to completely dry after being run through a dishwasher.', 'Fortunately, there are some good workarounds you can try. Apart from popular dish-drying hacks on TikTok (which reportedly have mixed results), you could try switching up how you load the dishwasher in the first place. The next time youâ\x80\x99re doing it, put those pesky plastic bowls, cups, and containers at an angle on the top rack. Instead of pooling up, the water should drip off more easily on its own. You might even want to grab a rinse aid, as this helps to reduce the waterâ\x80\x99s surface tension and enhances the drying process. ', 'If youâ\x80\x99re in the market for a new dishwasher, you may want to look at home appliance brands like GE, which have begun to factor plastic drying times into the designs for newer models.

Rather than tracing every word in this list back to its ultimate origin point, hereâ\x80\x99s (at least) one interesting way station each of these common words made on its journey to the present day, whether itâ\x80\x99s an analysis of the Latin roots, a hypothesis about a proto-Indo-European origin, or a pivotal change in meaning.Â\xa0', 'The word vaccine derives indirectly from the Latin for cow, vacca. The story goes that, just before the turn of the 19th century, a British doctor named Edward Jenner observed that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox, or variolae vaccinae, were much less likely to contract smallpox, which could otherwise devastate entire communities. Jenner decided to introduce the pus from a womanâ\x80\x99s cowpox lesion into a cut he made on an 8-year-old boyâ\x80\x99s arm.', 'Luckily for Dr. Jenner, the boy, and the human race at large, the cowpox pus provided a strong degree of smallpox protection, and the concept of a smallpox vaccine was born. Note the similarity between the word for vaccine and the word for cow in a number of Romance languages today: vacuna and vaca in Spanish, vaccino and vacca in Italian, and vacina and vaca in Portuguese, for example.Â\xa0', 'Two centuries and change later, vaccines have eradicated smallpox from the planet, and we continue to take inspiration from Jennerâ\x80\x99s coinage when discussing vaccinesâ\x80\x94even ones that donâ\x80\x99t come from cowpox pus.Â\xa0', 'Later genetic testing revealed that those first vaccines may have actually been using a virus closely related to horsepox, not cowpox. Maybe we should be referring to equination campaigns today, but when it comes to the sprawling way that language develops, it can be hard to get the horse-slash-cow back in the barn.', 'The word clue is a variant of clew, meaning a â\x80\x9cball of thread or yarn,â\x80\x9d according to Merriam-Webster. It comes to us from Middle and Old English, and the ball of yarn in question is a handy method for finding your way out of a labyrinth, as Greek mythologyâ\x80\x99s Theseus did after killing the Minotaur.', 'Louis Joseph Vanceâ\x80\x99s 1910 novel The Fortune Hunter includes the following line: â\x80\x9cHe simply canâ\x80\x99t lose, canâ\x80\x99t fail to cop out the best-looking girl with the biggest bank-roll in town.â\x80\x9d In that context, cop means something like get or grabâ\x80\x94a usage that survives today in a phase like â\x80\x9ccop a feel,â\x80\x9d and which may have roots in the Latin capereâ\x80\x94â\x80\x9cto takeâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94or the Old Frisian capia, â\x80\x9cto buy.â\x80\x9d Old Frisian, by the way, is a West Germanic language that some linguists consider a close relative of Old English.', 'Anyway, eventually one of the main things people were copping was out of further trouble by entering into something like a plea deal after being caught committing a crime.

It was the opposite of a pantheon, or place for all of the gods. Pandemonium was used in something more like its modern context in the Cheltenham Chronicle in 1819, when a writer invited his audience to â\x80\x9cLet any man, in his senses, take a view of the riotâ\x80\x94the confusionâ\x80\x94the furyâ\x80\x94the pandemonium of hatred, discord, and all bad feeling, let loose in the late contest for Westminster.â\x80\x9d', 'A writer is also responsible for the word robot, but in this case the word was coined not in an epic poem but in a play. In Karel Ä\x8capekâ\x80\x99s 1920 hit RUR, or â\x80\x9cRossumâ\x80\x99s Universal Robotsâ\x80\x9d in translation, Capek needed a word for the mechanical beings who go on to world domination in his story. After originally toying with the idea of using the Latin labori, or labor, as a departure point for labeling his soulless workers, Ä\x8capekâ\x80\x99s brother pointed him to the word robota, a term that, in Czech, is used in regards to serfdom. And itâ\x80\x99s actually in regard to the Central European system of serfdom that English had picked up the word robot decades earlier. That explains this wonderful line from a discourse about politics in 1855, long before the word was applied to mechanical beings: â\x80\x9cThe Austrian government has suppressed the robot.â\x80\x9d', 'Today, factoid is often used to mean a short, somewhat trivial factâ\x80\x94the kind of thing a website devoted to curiosity and fun facts often shares.

Though to be fair, air thatâ\x80\x99s beset by parasite-carrying mosquitoes definitely qualifies as bad air of some kind.', 'Mortgage comes from the Old French morgage, the roots of which, in literal translation, mean something like a â\x80\x9cdead pledge.â\x80\x9d But despite what you might have read online, thatâ\x80\x99s probably not because youâ\x80\x99ll be paying off your mortgage the rest of your life. Sir Edward Coke may have gotten closer to the mark in his Institutes of the Lawes of England back in 1628. Coke understands a mortgage as a sort of standoff, destined to end either when the borrower fails to pay, thus rendering the property â\x80\x9cdead to him,â\x80\x9d or when payment is delivered in full, in which case the agreement is dead to the lender.', 'You might read that checkmate comes from the Arabic al-shÄ\x81h mÄ\x81ta, meaning â\x80\x9cthe king died,â\x80\x9d but if you play chess youâ\x80\x99d recognize that this doesnâ\x80\x99t totally trackâ\x80\x94the king doesnâ\x80\x99t exactly die at the end of a game of chess, does he? A more plausible explanation for the word was offered, back in 1938, by M.E. Moghadam in the Journal of the American Oriental Society. Moghadam explained that the Persian shÄ\x81h-mÄ\x81t, meaning something like â\x80\x9cthe king is left (without a way to escape),â\x80\x9d seems a better reflection of both chess gameplay and the historical tradition of capturing a warring monarch rather than killing him as soon as possible.', 'Sinister comes from a Latin word that means â\x80\x9con the left side,â\x80\x9d a remnant of an outdated association between left-handed people and wickedness or other unsavory traits. That somewhat confusing anti-lefty bias may have roots in pure percentagesâ\x80\x94most of the population was, then as now, right-handed. Christianity might have also played a role. The Book of Matthew says that Jesus will divide the nations like a shepherd divides his sheep from his goats, with the (presumably pious) sheep sent to the Kingdom of Heaven on the right, and the cursed goats to the left.Â\xa0', 'The righty/lefty divide shows up in other etymologies: dexterity, or a skillfulness with oneâ\x80\x99s hands, comes from the latin dexter, meaning â\x80\x9con the right side.â\x80\x9d', 'The right-handed bias was so strong that when Sir Thomas Browne coined the term ambidextrous, referring to a person who can use their left and right hands equally well, he used the same Latin dexter with the prefix ambi-, meaning â\x80\x9cboth,â\x80\x9d basically describing someone as â\x80\x9cright-handed on both sides.â\x80\x9d', 'We know roughly when and where the word assassin originally comes from, but thereâ\x80\x99s some disagreement on the why. Hassan-i Sabbah lived from around 1050 to 1124. He called his secret religious order of Nizari followers AsÄ\x81siyyÅ«n, or â\x80\x9cthe faithful.â\x80\x9d And these followers did carry out what we would today call assassinations, targeted killings for political or religious reasons. But many sources, including Marco Polo, suggest that the word assassin had something to do with the word hashashin, or hash eaters. Polo spun a yarn about devotees being drugged with some kind of hash-infused liquid and then convinced to carry out killings. It doesnâ\x80\x99t seem the most plausible explanation, but even in modern times there doesnâ\x80\x99t seem to be unanimous acceptance of any one origin story.', 'The periodic table of the elements contains a hint about the origins of the word plumber. That Pb comes from the Latin for lead, plumbum, which also eventually gave us the word plumber. It originally referred to someone working with lead in a number of contexts, without its modern focus on the pipes that move water in and out of buildings. But since pipes were long made of lead, plumbers eventually became known as the people to call when your sink or toilet needs professional expertise.', 'There are still plenty of butchers around the world who will sell you goat meat, but in the United States and other English-speaking countries, you might also expect to find beef, chicken, or pork. The word butcher does seem to trace its origins through words like the Old French bochier, though, literally meaning â\x80\x9cslaughterer of goats.â\x80\x9d It seems an easy enough transition from there to any person who prepares and sells meat, goat or otherwise.', 'A midwife isnâ\x80\x99t halfway towards becoming your wife when she assists in your spouseâ\x80\x99s childbirth. The word instead combines the prefix mid-, which probably comes from the Middle English for â\x80\x9ctogether with,â\x80\x9d and an older use of the word wife referring not just to a female spouse but to any woman. A midwife is, indeed, with a woman when carrying out her job, even if that doesnâ\x80\x99t tell the full story of what they are doing to help.Â\xa0', 'A similarly passive role is suggested by the etymology for obstetric, which comes from the Latin obstetrÄ«x, basically a midwife. The Latin verb obstÄ\x81re means â\x80\x9cto stand in front of,â\x80\x9d as in standing in front of the birthing baby, which does accurately capture one facet of a midwifeâ\x80\x99s responsibilities. Today, obstetric is an adjective describing any number of things relating to childbirth.', 'The approval rating of pundits, as a profession, is probably on par with telemarketers and tummy tea peddlers. The wordâ\x80\x99s origin, though, points to the rarified air professional opinion-givers are meant to occupy. Pundit comes to us from a Sanskrit word that has been transliterated as pundit, pandit, or pandita (à¤ªà¤£à¥\x8dà¤¡à¤¿à¤¤). It originally referred to someone who had committed to memory a significant amount of the Hindu religious texts known as the Vedas. It came to refer more generally to something like â\x80\x9ca learned manâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cphilosopherâ\x80\x9d by the 19th century, and today that meaning has expanded to include people who like to yell at one another on cable news.', 'The word astronaut actually predates the real-life profession. It was used to refer to a spaceship, not a person, in Percy Gregâ\x80\x99s Across the Zodiac back in 1880.

The wordâ\x80\x99s Greek roots give it the literal, if still quite poetic, meaning of something like â\x80\x9cstar sailor.â\x80\x9d', 'You might think juggernaut has a similar Greek root, but it actually derives from Hindi. Jagat for â\x80\x9cworldâ\x80\x9d plus nÄ\x81tha for â\x80\x9clord or protectorâ\x80\x9d gave us jagannÄ\x81th, roughly â\x80\x9clord of the world,â\x80\x9d a Hindu deity. One story for how that specific usage led to our current understanding of the word involves the annual chariot festival that took place at the JagannÄ\x81th Temple in Puri, India. Reports of pilgrims being crushed under the procession of chariots may have given rise to juggernautâ\x80\x99s meaning as â\x80\x9ca massive inexorable force,â\x80\x9d though those reports may have been the product of a biased perspective from Western sources, rather than an accurate accounting of events.', 'Tycoon comes to the United States via the Japanese taikun, a word whose Chinese roots mean â\x80\x9cgreat ruler.â\x80\x9d When Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Japan in the 1850s, he wanted to meet with â\x80\x9ca dignitary of the highest rank in the empire.â\x80\x9d Perry seemed to think that meant the emperor, but in fact the shogun wielded more power in Japan at the time. Japanese officials used the title taikun to reflect the primacy of the shogunâ\x80\x99s power. The word caught on stateside and began to expand in meaning with usages like the one found in the New Orleans Daily Crescent on May 28, 1860. Critiquing then-Senator William Henry Sewardâ\x80\x99s approach to anti-slavery efforts, the paper claimed he â\x80\x9cappropriated to himself â\x80¦ the position of master and â\x80\x98Tycoonâ\x80\x99 of the Black Republicans.â\x80\x9d (â\x80\x9cBlack Republicansâ\x80\x9d was a pejorative for white politicians who wanted to do things like abolish slavery.) The word even found fans amongst Abraham Lincolnâ\x80\x99s aides during his presidencyâ\x80\x94they took to calling him â\x80\x9cthe Tycoonâ\x80\x9d in letters and diary entries.', 'Around the same time as Honest Abeâ\x80\x99s honest aides were writing about the Tycoon, an African elephant was being exhibited at Franceâ\x80\x99s Jardin des Plantes that would eventually become known as Jumbo. And though Jumboâ\x80\x99s tumultuous life as a celebrity pachyderm may well have popularized the word jumbo to mean anything very large, itâ\x80\x99s not necessarily where the word originally comes from. It was used to describe someone or something clumsy as early as 1823, and its use as slang likely predates that written record.', 'In The United States, at least, few people want to be called a â\x80\x9cnimrod.â\x80\x9d But once upon a time, it meant you were a hunter in the vein of the Old Testamentâ\x80\x99s Nimrod. Even today, Nimrod is a fairly common name in Israel. How it came to be a synonym for doofus in English is unclear. It could be through irony, or perhaps because the biblical figure Nimrod is sometimes (though not in Genesis) said to be associated with the ill-fated attempt to build the Tower of Babel. Whatever the origin, itâ\x80\x99s often stated that Bugs Bunny helped popularize the derogatory meaning of the word when he lobbed it at everyoneâ\x80\x99s favorite hapless hunter, Elmer Fudd. But no one ever actually mentions which â\x80\x98toon that was in; we found that Daffy actually calls Elmer â\x80\x9cnimrodâ\x80\x9d in 1948â\x80\x99s What Makes Daffy Duck. Bugs used it in reference to Yosemite Sam three years later in Rabbit Every Monday.Â\xa0', 'Bugs wasnâ\x80\x99t talking shades of red when he accused Elmer of being a maroon, and he wasnâ\x80\x99t calling him a chestnut, either. That is where we get the word maroon from, thoughâ\x80\x94from the French couleur marron, referring to a marron, or chestnut.', 'Many other colors take their names from objects in the world. Crimson, for example, can possibly be traced to the proto-Indo-European krmis, or worm, reflecting the fact that the color was once produced by crushing a specific type of worm.', 'Chartreuse owes its existence as a color to a liqueur of the same name made by Carthusian monks.', ""And orange comes from, well â\x80¦ oranges. Its predecessors include the Middle French orangeÂ\xa0 and the Sanskrit naranga-s, but whatâ\x80\x99s really interesting to note is that English didnâ\x80\x99t really have a word for this color for centuries. Geoffrey Chaucer, describing a fox in â\x80\x9cNunâ\x80\x99s Priest's Tale,â\x80\x9d went with the phrase â\x80\x9cbitwixe yelow and reed.â\x80\x9d Giolureade, or yellow-red, was a somewhat clumsy Old English construction that basically served the linguistic function of todayâ\x80\x99s orange for almost a millennium, as David Scott Kastan and Stephen Farthing point out in an essay on LitHub. Only once the fruit became widely available in Europe did the color start to infiltrate the continentâ\x80\x99s languages."", 'Dolphins are mammals, so it makes sense that the word dolphin comes from the ancient Greek delphys, or womb. But itâ\x80\x99s not 100 percent clear that the name dolphin came about because it seemed like a fish with a womb. Some believe that dolphins are actually shaped like a human womb, and other explanations suggest that the womb in question refers to a special bond between humans and dolphins, who did seem especially esteemed in ancient Greek culture. ', 'Porpoise, by the way, basically means â\x80\x9cpig-fishâ\x80\x9d (from porc, meaning â\x80\x9cpig,â\x80\x9d and, peis, meaning â\x80\x9cfishâ\x80\x9d).Â\xa0', 'Orangutan, on the other hand, goes back to the Malay orang utan, literally â\x80\x9cman of the woods.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'There are a number of words that derive from specific individuals. A dunce was once a descriptor for an acolyte of the Scottish theologian John Duns Scotus. As Dunsâ\x80\x99s ideas fell out of favor, the word came to its present-day pejorative meaningâ\x80\x94as Merriam-Webster describes it, â\x80\x9ca slow-witted or stupid person.â\x80\x9d', 'Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing political districts in an attempt to advantage a certain political party or constituency. The word comes to us from Governor Elbridge Gerry and a salamander. Or, more accurately, from the misshapen district that appeared in Massachusetts while Gerry was governor, which some claimed looked like a salamander. One origin story for the word says that poet Richard Alsop coined it at a dinner party in 1812. Thatâ\x80\x99s hard to confirm, but there is a record of Alsopâ\x80\x99s sometimes-collaborator Elkanah Tisdale drawing â\x80\x9cThe Gerry-Manderâ\x80\x9d as a satirical comic in an 1812 issue of the Boston Gazette.', 'You can boycott a company whose principles you disagree with by refusing to offer them your business, but the original boycott may have been a bit more like a boycott/strike hybrid. Retired British Army officer Captain Charles Boycott was managing the property of an absentee landlord in late 19th century Ireland. A rent dispute between Boycott and the farmers tending to the land led the tenants to stop working the fields and to shun the Englishman en masse. Local businesses followed suit, and Boycottâ\x80\x94rich in status but poor in access to useful resources like foodâ\x80\x94was driven out of town.', 'The saxophone takes its name from its inventor, Adolphe Sax, but it isnâ\x80\x99t the only musical instrument he put his name to: He also created the saxotromba, saxhorn, and saxtuba.', 'Nicotine, the addictive poison in tobacco, owes its name to the French diplomat Jean Nicot, who is traditionally credited with bringing tobacco plants to France.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s generally agreed that the word silhouette comes from the French author and politician Ã\x89tienne de Silhouette, but how that man lent his name to a particular style of image is a bit hard to say. On his website Word Histories, the French teacher and linguistics enthusiast Pascal TrÃ©guer lays out a number of theories, and finds himself most convinced by the version offered by an 1869 edition of the Journal Officiel de lâ\x80\x99Empire FranÃ§ais: that Ã\x89tienne de Silhouette, himself, pioneered the technique of drawing portraits in the silhouette style. This account claims that de Silhouette covered rooms of his castle with silhouette drawings, but as the castle was destroyed by a fire in 1871 it is unfortunately unverifiable today.', 'In 1824, Frenchman Louis Brailleâ\x80\x94then just a teenagerâ\x80\x94took a pre-existing code and used it to develop the original braille system for reading and writing, inspired by his own needs as a Blind person. (He lost his vision in an accident in his fatherâ\x80\x99s tool shop when he was 3 years old.) Braille, a talented musician, later adapted the system so it could be used for musical notation as well.', 'German inventor Rudolf Diesel developed the diesel engine and Israeli Major Uziel Gal designed the Uzi submachine gun.', 'Chronology comes to us from the Greek khronos, or â\x80\x9ctime.â\x80\x9d Chronus (who is not necessarily synonymous with the leader of the Titans, Cronus), was the Greek personification of time.', 'We all know what an echo is, and the story of the nymph Echo points to that meaning. According to Ovidâ\x80\x99s Metamorphoses, Jupiterâ\x80\x99s wife Juno condemned Echo to only speak the last words spoken to her.', 'Echo was scorned by the hunter Narcissus, who famously fell in love with his own reflection. This story provided inspiration to German physiatrist Paul NÃ¤cke to coin the term that would, in English, become narcissism. NÃ¤cke used the word to describe a person who treated their â\x80\x9cown body as if it were a sexual object, in lieu of having sexual desires for other people,â\x80\x9d in the words of PsychologyToday.com. In the ensuing years the meaning of the word expanded through its use by figures like Sigmund Freud. Today, it can be used in reference to anyone with excessive egoism or a tendency to megalomania.', 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but sometimes itâ\x80\x99s a cicadaâ\x80\x94at least according to one of the more popular theories about cigarâ\x80\x99s etymology. The Spanish word for cigar, cigarro, is a lot like the Spanish word for cicada: cigarra. This has led some to speculate that cigars were named for their rough resemblance to the cylindrical bug. Another explanation is that cigar comes from the Mayan word sikar, meaning â\x80\x9cto smoke.â\x80\x9d', 'If you call your cigar a stogie, you have the township of Conestoga, Pennsylvania, to thank. Some say thatâ\x80\x99s because an early cigar factory was built in the area, but more sources seem to think it has to do with the smoking habits of the men who drove so-called Conestoga wagons.', 'The Oxford English Dictionary says that the Greek ancestor of the word oreganoâ\x80\x94origanosâ\x80\x94is â\x80\x9cprobably a loanword,â\x80\x9d as the plant itself comes from Africa. But Greek speakers came up with a pretty convincing folk etymology for the word based on its sounds. Orei means â\x80\x9cmountainâ\x80\x9d in Greek and ganos means â\x80\x9cbrightness or joy,â\x80\x9d giving the word a perhaps-apocryphal but still evocative meaning as something like â\x80\x9cjoy of the mountain.â\x80\x9d', 'The word tulip comes to us through a â\x80\x9clatinized version of the Turkish word for turban, TÃ¼lbend,â\x80\x9d according to the Amsterdam Tulip Museum, presumably because the shape of the flower resembles some versions of the headwear.', 'Daisy comes from the Old English phrase dÃ¦gesege, or â\x80\x9cdayâ\x80\x99s eye,â\x80\x9d a nod to the flowerâ\x80\x99s habit of closing up at dusk and opening at dawn.', 'Orchids may be beautiful, but their etymology isnâ\x80\x99t quite so poetic. The word comes from the Greek orkhis, for testicle, thought to reflect the shape of the plantâ\x80\x99s underground storage organs. In Middle English, in fact, the plant was known as ballockwort.Â\xa0', 'Whatâ\x80\x99s the origin of the universe? Linguistically speaking, that is. In John D. Barrowâ\x80\x99s Book of Universes, he traces the word to the Latin universum, composed of the roots unus, or one, and versus, a conjugation of a verb meaning â\x80\x9cto turn, rotate, roll or change.â\x80\x9d That gives us a literal meaning of something like â\x80\x9crolled into one.â\x80\x9d That could just reflect that the universe is everything kind of rolled up into one all-encompassing thing, or a specific cosmological belief from antiquity, when it was thought that â\x80\x9cthe outer crystalline sphere of the heavens rotated and thereby communicated change and movement to the planetary spheres inside it.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Sometime between the Big Bang and today, someone got the bright idea to start a school. It might surprise teenagers to know that the wordâ\x80\x99s antecedent, the Greek scholÃ\xad, actually meant something like â\x80\x9cleisure or spare time.â\x80\x9d In ancient Athens and Rome, a favorite use of spare time was to engage in learned discussion, at least among a certain subset of the population.', 'If you trade sandwiches with your classmate at lunch time, you can call them your â\x80\x9ccompanion.â\x80\x9d The word comes from the Latin com, or â\x80\x9ctogether with,â\x80\x9d and panis, for â\x80\x9cbread or food.â\x80\x9d That makes the wordâ\x80\x99s original meaning something like â\x80\x9cone who you break bread with.â\x80\x9d', 'Window comes from the Old Norse vindauga, or â\x80\x9cwind eye.â\x80\x9d It originally referred to a hole in the roof, but over the years made the jump down to glazed glass usually found on a wall.', 'While weâ\x80\x99re talking architectural origins, Iâ\x80\x99ll point out that eavesdrop comes, a bit indirectly, from the Old English yfesdrype, the ""place around a house where the rainwater drips off the roof,â\x80\x9d according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. An eavesdropper thus became someone who â\x80\x9cstands at walls or windows to overhear whatâ\x80\x99s going on,â\x80\x9d which may have been back-formed into the verb eavesdrop.', 'A gossip was originally a godsibb in Old English, and it was basically a godparentâ\x80\x94someone who acted as a sponsor at a baptism. By the 14th century the word could encompass any familiar acquaintance, especially women who were invited to a friendâ\x80\x99s birth. Through a long line of loose talkers or perhaps some old-fashioned sexism, the word evolved to mean anyone engaged in idle talk, and eventually gossip took on its modern meaning as baseless rumor or trifling talk.', 'Sixty words in, and we finally have an etymology Rebecca Black can get behind. Friday was, in Old English, FrigedÃ¦g, named for a Germanic goddess of love.Â\xa0', 'An amateur does something not for pay, but simply because they love it. It makes sense, then, that its Latin root is amare, â\x80\x9cto love.â\x80\x9d', 'Flower comes from the French fleur, and so does flour. The part of a plant used to make flourâ\x80\x94the kind that you millâ\x80\x94was considered the â\x80\x9cflower of the grain,â\x80\x9d the best part.', 'Anthology has its own floral origin. The Greek anthos, or â\x80\x9cflower,â\x80\x9d and logia, meaning â\x80\x9ca collection,â\x80\x9d gave us anthologia, literally something like â\x80\x9ca collection of flowers,â\x80\x9d but with an early meaning describing a collection of poems.', 'Bouquet was probably introduced to English by Lady Mary Montague from the French word of the same spelling. Montague, by the way, also familiarized English readers with the â\x80\x9clanguage of flowersâ\x80\x9d based on her experiences abroadâ\x80\x94the idea that a lily symbolizes purity, for example. Bouquet can be traced back to the Medieval Latin boscus, or grove, as in a group of trees. The word bouquet originally meant something like â\x80\x9clittle wood.â\x80\x9d', 'Walruses have their own interesting etymology, though it too is a bit hard to pin down definitively. In fact, a onetime employee of the Oxford English Dictionary hand-wrote a number of versions of the wordâ\x80\x99s originsâ\x80\x94six of which survive in the archives. That OED employee was one J.R.R. Tolkien, and his favored explanation went back through Dutch to the Old Norse word rosmhvalr.', 'Tolkien went on to coin or redefine a number of words in building out his fantasy worlds, but one of his most famous creations may not have been entirely his. The author himself said he coined the word hobbit in a moment of inspiration, and his son Michael recalled hearing his father use the word in stories he invented for his children. ', 'Later in life, though, Tolkien expressed a degree of doubtâ\x80\x94after all, it would have been easy to have once seen or heard the word and then unconsciously incorporate it into his personal vocabulary. Pre-Tolkien uses of hobbit were eventually discovered, including in The Denham Tracts, a compendium of British folklore collected in the mid-1800s, in which they were listed as a type of supernatural creature. Whether this was a case of parallel thinking or unintended influence may be impossible to say, butâ\x80\x94befitting a philologist such as Tolkienâ\x80\x94the author eventually created his own retroactive etymology for hobbit, deciding that it derived from holbytla, from Old English roots meaning â\x80\x9chole-dweller.â\x80\x9d', 'Nice once meant â\x80\x9cfoolish,â\x80\x9d from the Old French nice, or â\x80\x9cignorant,â\x80\x9d from the Latin nescius. Over the centuries nice went through a dizzying array of meanings, with stops at â\x80\x9ctimid or faint-hearted,â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cfussy or fastidious,â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cdainty or delicate,â\x80\x9d before arriving at â\x80\x9cpleasant or agreeableâ\x80\x9d by the 19th century.Â\xa0', 'Canaries are, strangely enough, named after dogs.

The islands, in turn, take their name from the Latin for dog, canis, though itâ\x80\x99s not entirely clear why. Some accounts say this is because people who visited the Islands found them populated with dogs, and perhaps even residents who venerated their four-legged friends. Others believe the dogs in question were actually monk seals, which are sometimes called â\x80\x9csea dogs.â\x80\x9d', 'The Latin word nescius comes from the prefix ne-, for not, and a form of the Latin verb scire, â\x80\x9cto know.â\x80\x9d That verb also eventually gave us science, which even today isnâ\x80\x99t far from its mid-14th century meaning, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary: â\x80\x9cWhat is known, knowledge (of something) acquired by study; information.â\x80\x9d', 'Are you a logophile?

But if you spend enough time in the water, you might notice that your bladder seems more active than when youâ\x80\x99re on dry land. One study found that a 110,000-gallon pool contained roughly 8 gallons of urine. Does being immersed in water suddenly increase your urge to go?', 'Turns out the answer is yes. The reason is something known as immersion diuresis, a term for the body increasing its urine output in response to being submerged in water. Your blood vessels constrict, moving blood to your internal organs. That raises your blood pressure, which can increase activity in your kidneys because the body wants to release fluid to compensate for the arterial changes. The net result: the urge to pee.', 'Your kidneys can also act in response to water pressure, which can increase when you dive further down. Again, blood pressure is increasing, and your kidneys are filtering out more fluid.', 'Immersion diuresis increases with cold water, which makes it more of an issue in open bodies rather than heated poolsâ\x80\x94though simply being in the pool for long periods of time can result in a normal need to urinate. Nerves can have an effect, too. Plenty of Olympic swimmers have admitted to peeing in pools.', 'Peeing with an athletic legacy on the line is one thing. Opting whether just to go while playing with a pool noodle in a friendâ\x80\x99s above-ground pool is another. If you need to go, should you go? In open water, itâ\x80\x99s not really an issue. Plenty of distance swimmers let loose. In a swimming pool, the answer is trickier. While some bacteria exists in urine, itâ\x80\x99s generally not enough to make you or others ill, particularly when a pool is being treated with chlorine. Itâ\x80\x99s more about manners.

166,8 Amazing Facts About Earth,"['climate change', 'environment', 'extinction', 'nasa', 'news', 'science']","['Itâ\x80\x99s probably best if we donâ\x80\x99t think too much about Earth. After all, itâ\x80\x99s a tiny orb spinning more than 1000 mph at the equator while simultaneously zipping through space at 67,000 mph. It circles a mysterious, 10,000Â°F sun thatâ\x80\x99s more than 100 times its size, and spends most of its orbit narrowly (in a cosmic sense) avoiding collisions with giant chunks of rock that could practically wipe its surface clean. But if youâ\x80\x99re feeling brave, here are a few things you might not know about Earth. ', 'In 2017, Mental Floss spoke to Josh Willis, a climate scientist at NASAâ\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, about the planet we call home.', ""As you probably know, at this distance, it takes one year for Earth to complete one revolution of its orbit, and 24 hours to complete one rotation on its axis. The surface of Earth has temperatures ranging from -126Â°F to 136Â°F. The planet is about 7900 miles in diameter (though the deepest we've ever drilled is 7.6 miles). There are roughly 332.5 cubic miles of water on the planet, which is enough that, if the water broke away from Earth and organized itself into a sphere, it would have a diameter of 860 milesâ\x80\x94about 40 percent that of the moon."", ' Itâ\x80\x99s a grainy, black-and-white shot of a tiny slice of our world, curved with the ink of space as a backdrop. In 1960, weather satellites began sending photographs back to Earth, images that were still hideously deformed but scientifically valuable, especially for meteorologists, who now had stunning views of cloud systems from which to work. NASAâ\x80\x99s ATS-III satellite in 1967 returned the first color images of Earth in its entirety. At last, we could see our living world, ringed in space and wrapped in billowing clouds.', 'On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders sent back Earthrise, a now-iconic photograph of a fragile cerulean orb rising over the lunar surface. But the most famous photograph of the Earth, by far, was taken about four years later, on December 7, 1972: the Blue Marble. Youâ\x80\x99ve probably seen it countless times, but you may be less familiar with how astronaut Harrison Schmitt described the sight to Mission Control: â\x80\x9cIâ\x80\x99ll tell you, if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, itâ\x80\x99s the Earth right now.â\x80\x9d', 'Earth is the first planet, moving outward from the sun, that possesses a moon. We call our moon â\x80\x9cthe moonâ\x80\x9d (which will be a real headache centuries from now, when weâ\x80\x99ve colonized the solar system). Every 27.32 days, the moon completes an orbit of Earth, which is why it has phases. When Earth is between the sun and the moon, we see the moon in full illumination (a round orb). As it circles Earth, less and less of its visible surface is illuminated, until at last the moon is between the sun and Earth. At that point, the â\x80\x9cfar sideâ\x80\x9d of the moon is in full illumination, and from our perspective, the moon is receiving no light at all. The cycle then repeats itself, with more of its disc being illuminated as the month elapses, until it is again full. Because the length of the moonâ\x80\x99s orbit is just shy of a month, every so often a month (which derives from the word moon) has two full moons, the second of which is called a blue moon.', 'The moon does spin, but in synchronous rotation with Earth. In other words, it spins at the same speed as its orbit. As a result, Earth gets to see only one side of our only natural satellite. The best guess for the origin of the moon involves an object the size of Mars smashing into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, sending debris into space. This debris organized itself into a molten form of the alabaster orb we know and love. Within 100 million years, an early crust had begun to form. Today, the moon influences the tides of the ocean and eases our axial wobble, keeping things (more or less) nice and stableâ\x80\x94a perfect condition for life.', ""When it comes to life, there are a lot of maybes in the solar system. Maybe Mars supported life billions of years ago. Maybe Jupiter's moon Europa is teeming with life today. The problem is that there is no evidence anywhere of anything that wiggles, walks, or swims â\x80¦ except on Earth. And it has been tough going."", 'Four billion years ago, Earthâ\x80\x99s surface was sterilized during the Late Heavy Bombardment, when asteroids pummeled the inner solar system. To get some idea of what things must have been like during the LHB, look at the moon. Most of its craters were formed during that time. Life survived on Earth in large part thanks to the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.', 'There have been five mass extinctions on Earth, the worst of which (the Permian-Triassic, or â\x80\x9cP-T Eventâ\x80\x9d) was 250 million years ago, wiping out 96 percent of marine species and nearly three-quarters of land vertebrates. Sixty-six million years ago, the Chicxulub impact wiped out 75 percent of all life and ended the reign of the dinosaurs. Things recovered nicely, though, and today, biologists think there could be 8.7 million species of life on Earth. Thatâ\x80\x99s not bad considering the universeâ\x80\x99s apparent hostility to life, and makes what we have going here all the more special and worth preserving. And weâ\x80\x99d better get on it: Many scientists argue that weâ\x80\x99re in the midst of a sixth mass extinctionâ\x80\x94and we can only partially blame it on cats.', 'â\x80\x9cGlobal warming is real, itâ\x80\x99s caused by people, and itâ\x80\x99s a big problem,â\x80\x9d Willis told Mental Floss in 2017. â\x80\x9cEvery year the impacts of human-caused climate change get bigger and bigger, and are felt more and more across the planet.â\x80\x9d We feel the effects of climate change today, but the worst is yet to come in terms of economic and social disruption: â\x80\x9cRight now we have a choice about what kind of planet we want to have in the future. And the choice is: Do we want to continue to burn fossil fuels and heat up Earth, or do we want to try and stabilize our climate and keep it more or less like weâ\x80\x99ve had it for the last 10,000 years?â\x80\x9d', 'Icy moons like Europa and Enceladus have subsurface oceans of liquid water, and Titan, in addition to a possible subsurface water ocean, has vast lakes of liquid methane covering its surfaceâ\x80\x94but no other celestial object has oceans of H2O like ours.', ""Unfortunately, they're rising. NASA's Jason-3 spacecraft measures the height of the ocean with 1-inch accuracy. Every 10 days, it collects data on the entire ocean, revealing details about such things as ocean currents and how they change, tilts in the ocean's surface, and the average volume of the ocean. â\x80\x9cThe oceans are growing for two reasons,â\x80\x9d Willis said. â\x80\x9cOne is because they absorb heat trapped by the greenhouse gases, and the other is that the ice in places like Greenland and Antarctica and tiny glaciers all across the planet are all melting and adding extra water to the oceans. This satellite measures these things combined, and in a way itâ\x80\x99s really taking the pulse of our planet.â\x80\x9d"", 'A decade ago, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica were thought of as stable. They are the last remaining ice sheets that cover huge land masses, and today they are disappearing. In 50 years, their melting will be the dominant source of global sea level rise. ""Every time a big discovery is made,"" says Willis, ""it seems like the picture is worse than we thought it was. The possibility for really rapid ice loss and rapid sea level rise is greater than we thought.""', 'The oceans remain a giant unknown for scientists. Knowing more about them would answer many of our questions about life and the life of Earth. â\x80\x9cTwo-thirds of the planet is covered with water, and you canâ\x80\x99t see through it. And you canâ\x80\x99t shoot microwaves through it, and radio waves, and all the other kinds of things that we use even to measure other planets,â\x80\x9d Willis said. â\x80\x9cIf you probe the ocean, there are still a lot of big mysteries down there.â\x80\x9d', 'To understand how oceans really work would explain, for example, where the heat from global warming is going. Though the oceans absorb 95 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, itâ\x80\x99s still a mystery where that heat energy actually goes. Similar questions exist as to how the oceans interact with ice sheets.', 'But it will take a concerted effort to change our behaviorâ\x80\x94before itâ\x80\x99s too late. â\x80\x9cWe think of global warming as something that happens in our cities, and it is happening there, but really 95 percent of the heat thatâ\x80\x99s being trapped is going in the oceans. And I donâ\x80\x99t think people realize that. It just seems like, well, weâ\x80\x99re getting the brunt of global warming here in Los Angelesâ\x80\x94but thatâ\x80\x99s not true, really. Itâ\x80\x99s the sea life and the oceans that are getting the brunt of the change,â\x80\x9d Willis said.', ""â\x80\x9cOne thing we should keep in mind is that all hope is not lost,â\x80\x9d he continued. â\x80\x9cWe are beginning to see changes in our economy, weâ\x80\x99re beginning to see the growth of renewable energy, and the strong desire to move to a fuel source that doesn't cook us, and I think thatâ\x80\x99s a good thing.â\x80\x9d"", 'A version of this story was published in 2017; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501978/8-things-you-need-know-about-earth

Regan also found a smaller fish attached to a female ceratioid. When he dissected it, he realized it wasnâ\x80\x99t a different species or the female anglerâ\x80\x99s child. It was her mate.', 'The â\x80\x9cmissingâ\x80\x9d males had been there all along, just unrecognized and misclassified, and Regan and other scientists, like Norwegian zoologist Albert Eide Parr, soon figured out why the male ceratioids looked so different. They donâ\x80\x99t need lures or big mouths and teeth because they donâ\x80\x99t hunt, and they donâ\x80\x99t hunt because they have the females. The ceratioid male, Regan wrote, is â\x80\x9cmerely an appendage of the female, and entirely dependent on her for nutrition.â\x80\x9d In other words, a parasite.', 'When ceratioid males go looking for love, they follow a species-specific pheromone to a female, who will often aid their search further by flashing her bioluminescent lure. Once the male finds a suitable mate, he bites into her belly and latches on until his body fuses with hers. Their skin joins together, and so do their blood vessels, which allows the male to take all the nutrients he needs from his host/mateâ\x80\x99s blood. The two fish essentially become one.', 'With his body attached to hers like this, the male doesnâ\x80\x99t have to trouble himself with things like seeing or swimming or eating like a normal fish. The body parts he doesnâ\x80\x99t need anymoreâ\x80\x94eyes, fins, and some internal organsâ\x80\x94atrophy, degenerate, and wither away, until heâ\x80\x99s little more than a lump of flesh hanging from the female, taking food from her and providing sperm whenever sheâ\x80\x99s ready to spawn.', 'Extreme size differences between the sexes and parasitic mating arenâ\x80\x99t found in all anglerfish. Throughout the other suborders, there are males that are free-swimming their whole lives, that can hunt on their own and that only attach to the females temporarily to reproduce before moving along. For deep-sea ceratioids that might only rarely bump into each other in the abyss, though, the weird mating ritual is a necessary adaptation to keep mates close at hand and ensure that there will always be more little anglerfish. And for us, itâ\x80\x99s something to both marvel and cringe at, a reminder that the natural world is often as strange as any fiction we can imagine.', 'Naturalist William Beebe put it nicely in 1938, writing, â\x80\x9cBut to be driven by impelling odor headlong upon a mate so gigantic, in such immense and forbidding darkness, and willfully eat a hole in her soft side, to feel the gradually increasing transfusion of her blood through oneâ\x80\x99s veins, to lose everything that marked one as other than a worm, to become a brainless, senseless thing that was a fishâ\x80\x94this is sheer fiction, beyond all belief unless we have seen the proof of it.â\x80\x9d', 'A version of this article was originally published in 2014 and has been updated for 2023.

170,10 Fascinating Facts About Corpse Flowers,"['flowers', 'nature', 'plants', 'science']","['Big. Smelly. Rare. Phallic. These adjectives all describe Amorphophallus titanum, commonly known as the corpse flower. While native to western Indonesia, the plant takes Instagram by storm every time it blooms in botanical gardens. Hereâ\x80\x99s some trivia to celebrate one of natureâ\x80\x99s stinkiest plants.', 'No, itâ\x80\x99s not just you: Amorphophallus titanum really does look like a large, lumpy penis. In fact, the plant gets its scientific name from three roots: amorphos (without form), phallos (penis), and titanum (giant).', 'Canâ\x80\x99t say the plantâ\x80\x99s Latin name in polite company without blushing? Thanks to David Attenborough, the English naturalist and BBC host, you can also opt to use its common name, titan arum. While narrating the BBC nature documentary series The Private Life of Plants, Attenborough thought the corpse flowerâ\x80\x99s proper name was too improper to say on TV, so he coined a less-scandalous moniker. Or, you could simply go with its Indonesian name, bunga bangkai.', 'In 1878, Italian botanist Odoardo Beccari came across the enormous plant growing in the rainforests of Sumatra, a large island in western Indonesia. The specimen he recorded had a circumference of around 5 feet, and its height was around 10 feet.', 'Beccari tried to ship the flowering shrubâ\x80\x99s corms, or giant underground tubers, back to Europe, but French customs ended up holding them under an order designed to prevent the spread of the grapevine pest Phylloxera. Still, a few seeds survived against the odds, and a single seedling was sent to the Kew Botanic Gardens in England, where Beccari had once studied. There, it flowered in 1889. In 1926, when the same corpse flower bloomed again, the crowds were so large that police were brought in to control them.', 'Not surprisingly, the corpse flower quickly gained notoriety in Europe: An English artist hired to illustrate the plant is said to have become ill from the odor, and governesses forbade young ladies from looking at it, for obvious reasons.', 'Technically, a corpse flower is a flowering plant with clusters of blooms. The plant consists of a thick central spike, known as a spadix, with a base thatâ\x80\x99s encircled by two rings of male and female flowers. A large, frilly leaf called a spathe envelops these flowers to protect them.', 'Aside from its smell, a corpse flowerâ\x80\x99s most noticeable quality is its sheer size. The plant holds the record for the worldâ\x80\x99s largest unbranched inflorescence (a fancy term for describing a floral structure made of many smaller individual flowers), and it can reach heights of up to 12 feet in the wild. Cultivated corpse flowers are smaller, measuring anywhere from 6 to 8 feet.', 'Years, or even decades, can pass before a corpse flower reaches peak bloom. As the big moment finally approaches, the plantâ\x80\x99s bud grows several inches per day before slowing down its growth. Two protective leaves, called bracts, shrivel and fall off the spatheâ\x80\x99s base. Then, the spathe unfurls over roughly 24 to 36 hours, giving curious onlookers just a small window to see (and smell) its maroon-colored insides for themselves.', 'When a corpse flower blooms, the spadix heats up to temperatures of up to 98Â°F as the plant unleashes a stench akin to rotting flesh. â\x80\x9cThose pulses of heat cause the air to rise, like a chimney effect,â\x80\x9d Ray Mims, a spokesperson for the U.S. Botanic Garden, explained to Washingtonian magazine. â\x80\x9cIt gets the stench up in the airâ\x80\x9d to attract pollinating dung beetles and carrion beetles, which are drawn to the scent of rotting flesh.', 'Experts have identified different fragrant molecules responsible for the titan arumâ\x80\x99s stink, including dimethyl trisulfide (like limburger cheese), trimethylamine (rotting fish), and isovaleric acid (sweaty socks).', 'Once a corpse flower finishes blooming, it doesnâ\x80\x99t die. The spathe withers and collapses after a few days, and if pollinated, the plant soon produces hundreds of small, golden-colored fruits. These berry-like seeds are eaten and dispersed by animals such as birds, or harvested in captivity by garden conservation scientists. (No word on how they taste, as theyâ\x80\x99re reportedly not suitable for human consumption.)', 'Once the seeds ripen from gold to dark orange, and then to dark redâ\x80\x94a stage that lasts for five or six monthsâ\x80\x94the corpse flower goes dormant. Then, it sprouts as a tree-like leaf during its next few life cycles as it stores away energy from the sun. Each cycle, the leaf grows bigger and bigger, before dying. Once the plantâ\x80\x99s corm is fully replenished, it finally blooms again.', 'In 1937, the New York Botanical Garden became the proud home of Americaâ\x80\x99s first recorded corpse flower bloom. Two years later, yet another flower bloomed in the Bronx garden. Borough president James J. Lyons was so tickled, he designated Amorphophallus titanum as the Bronxâ\x80\x99s official flower. â\x80\x9cIts tremendous size shall be symbolic of the fastest-growing borough in the City of New York,â\x80\x9d Lyons said, according to The New York Times. Meanwhile, news crews covering the event are said to have nearly fainted from the smell.', 'The Bronx used the corpse flower as a symbol until 2000, when then-borough president Fernando Ferrer, aiming to overhaul the municipalityâ\x80\x99s image, changed its official flower to the day lily. â\x80\x9cI hate to think of the corpse flower as the Bronx flower, because people would think the Bronx and think, â\x80\x98The Bronx stinks,â\x80\x99â\x80\x9d Michael Ruggiero, then senior curator for horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden, told the Times. â\x80\x9cThe Bronx is a people place, and the corpse flower is not a people plant. The day lily is, and therefore is a good fit for the Bronx.â\x80\x9d', 'Corpse flowers arenâ\x80\x99t just rareâ\x80\x94theyâ\x80\x99re also vulnerable to habitat loss and destruction, as vast swaths of Sumatraâ\x80\x99s rainforests are chopped down for timber and to clear ground for oil palm plantations. According to one estimate provided by the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, Indonesia has lost about three-quarters of its original rainforest cover. This contributes to the flowerâ\x80\x99s demise, and also threatens important pollinators.', 'A version of this story ran in 2017; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/503962/10-stinky-facts-about-corpse-flowers
171,12 Powerful Facts About Tornadoes,"['science', 'weather', 'history', 'news', 'lists']","['Often spinning over 100 miles per hour, a tornado is a violently rotating column of air in contact with the Earth and clouds that can cause major destruction. The powerful Tuscaloosa-Birmingham tornado of 2011, for example, lofted a 36-ton empty coal hopper rail car almost 400 feet. The equally impressive Hackleburg tornado on the same day carried jeans from a damaged denim factory more than 40 miles. Here are 12 facts about these dangerous whirlwinds.', 'When winds higher in the atmosphere are moving faster than wind closer to the ground, this creates vertical wind shear, which is a change in wind speed or wind direction with height. Much like a paddle wheel, this wind shear generates horizontal rotation. But to become a tornado, the horizontal rotation needs to become vertical. When a cool, dry air mass covers warm moist air, the overlap creates instability: The hot air wants to rise because itâ\x80\x99s less dense, forming updrafts. This updraft can tilt the horizontal rotation into vertical rotationâ\x80\x94the beginnings of a tornado.', 'A cap of warmer air can prevent this rotation from tilting, because it can block the updrafts from penetrating very high into the atmosphere. But if conditions changeâ\x80\x94say, as the heat of the day reaches its peak by mid- to late-afternoonâ\x80\x94rising air from the surface layer of air becomes warmer than the cap, breaking it. Air can now ascend several miles into the sky. A thunderstorm with a rotating updraftâ\x80\x94a supercellâ\x80\x94will develop.', 'However, even when all these ingredients are present, the supercell may not produce a tornado. Scientists are still trying to identify the triggering mechanism is that turns a supercell into a twister. â\x80\x9cThe atmosphere has a way of getting the four together in ways with minor differences to either create a large EF5 tornado or a just some rain. We donâ\x80\x99t know when and where these ingredients form in just the right way,â\x80\x9d Roger Edwards, lead forecaster at the Storm Prediction Center,Â\xa0told Science of the South.Â\xa0In fact, 70 percent of tornado warnings issued are for storms that never produce tornadoes. It may seem like crying wolf, but think of the 30 percent of warnings that are accurate. And not all tornadoes come from supercells:Â\xa0With names like gustnado and landspout (cousin to the more famous waterspout), these form in unique ways but are much weaker than supercell tornadoes.', 'Tornadoes have occurred on every continent except Antarctica. However, the region known as Tornado Alley, in the south-central U.S., has earned that name for a good reason: Though it accounts for just 15 percent of the land in the U.S., itâ\x80\x99s seen nearly 30 percent of the countryâ\x80\x99s tornadoes, with 16,674 twisters touching down there between 1950 and 2010. It averages 268 tornadoes per year. These tornadoes arise because of a clash between warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico near the ground, colder air in the upper atmosphere from the west, and a third layer of very warm dry air between the two levels from the southwest that tries to keep the other two at bay.', 'Researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville have discovered that topography and roughness of the landscape can also influence the power of a tornado. In simulations, the â\x80\x9crougherâ\x80\x9d the area is, the stronger and wider a tornado can get. Forested areas have a rougher surface than open agricultural areas, and forested mountains are even rougher, according toÂ\xa0Kevin Knupp, lead of the Alabama research team. But the picture is more complicated than that, according to his colleagueÂ\xa0Anthony Lyza, who has found thatÂ\xa0tornadoesÂ\xa0in Alabama are affected by topography. According to Lyza, tornadoes weaken as they proceed up mountains and hillsâ\x80\x94but they strengthen as they proceed down. And sometimes, regardless of whether a tornado is moving up or down a hill or mountain, the land mass will cause a tornado to dissipate.', 'Tetsuya Fujita was a Japanese meteorologist living in the town of Kokura during World War II. Kokura was the primary target of one of the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan, but due to cloudy conditions, that bomb was unleashed on its secondary targetâ\x80\x94Nagasaki. Fujitaâ\x80\x99s study of the damage of the nuclear bomb blasts led to the discovery of meteorological phenomena called microbursts, among many other breakthroughs. Fujitaâ\x80\x99s passion for storms earned him the nickname â\x80\x9cMr. Tornadoâ\x80\x9d from his colleagues at the University of Chicago.', 'Before 1971, all tornadoes were essentially treated the same, regardless of strength, size, path, or damage zone. That year, Fujita released his method of categorizing them: The F-scale, which indirectly measures the wind speed of a tornado. Because of difficulties getting accurate wind speeds inside a tornado, Fujita looked at how much destruction various tornadoes caused and back-calculated wind speeds based on that. He then created a scale that ranged from F1 to F12, linking together the Beaufort scale of wind strength, long used by mariners and meteorologists, and Mach scale (yes, like jets). An F1 tornado corresponds to a 12 on the Beaufort scale, and an F12 corresponds to Mach 1. He then added an F0 (40-72 mph) to have a baseline at a level that wouldnâ\x80\x99t cause appreciableÂ\xa0damage to most structures (influenced by Beaufortâ\x80\x99s 0â\x80\x94calm/no wind), and maxed the tornado part of the scale at F5 (261-318 mph).Â\xa0An F5 is the highest rating given to a tornado, because Fujita believed this to be the theoretical upper limit for how fast winds in a tornado could reach.', 'An F0 causes light damage to chimneys, breaks tree branches, and damages billboards. An F5 causes incredible damage.Â\xa0It can lift framed houses off their foundations and carry them a considerable distance. It can toss cars more than 300 feet through the air. It can completely debark trees. Even steel-reinforced concrete isnâ\x80\x99t safe.', 'According to meteorologist Charles A. Doswell, there are problems with using the F-scale. â\x80\x9cThe real-world application of the F-scale has always been in terms of damage, not wind speed,â\x80\x9d he told Science of the South.Â\xa0â\x80\x9cUnfortunately, the relationship between the wind speeds and the damage categories has not been tested in any comprehensive way.â\x80\x9d', 'In 2004 and 2005, dozens of meteorologists and civil engineersÂ\xa0collaboratedÂ\xa0through a research center at Texas Tech University onÂ\xa0a more objective scale, which they named theÂ\xa0Enhanced Fujita Scale. A year later, the EF-scale went into use in the U.S. The EF-scale has more rigorous and standardized measures of damage, adds additional building and vegetation types, accounts for differences in construction quality, dramatically lowers the wind speeds associated with stronger tornadoes,Â\xa0and expands degrees of damage. Or, as the tornado-chasing character played by Bill Paxton in Twister (1996) puts it, â\x80\x9cIt measures a tornadoâ\x80\x99s intensity by how much it eats.â\x80\x9d', 'Although radar originated in the 1930s, it wasnâ\x80\x99t used for the weather until the 1950s.Â\xa0The first radar detection of a tornado occurred in 1953,Â\xa0using a radar designed for naval aircraft. Far more important was the discovery of the tornado vortex signature in 1973, based on observation of a tornado in Union City, Oklahoma. Scientists discovered there was a telltale pattern that appeared before the tornado formed.', 'Before then, researchers had used films, photos, or damage markings for clues. The discovery of the tornado vortex signature led to the modern tornado warning system in the U.S., including a national network of next-generation Doppler radars (NEXRAD) operated by the National Weather Service, the Air Force, and the Federal Aviation Administration.', 'The tornado vortex signature appears on the radar as red/yellow (indicating high outbound velocity) and green/blue (inbound velocity) pixels occurring adjacent to each other over a relatively small area. This is also called a velocity couplet, and itâ\x80\x99s associated with the mesocyclone, the rotating vortex of air within the supercell. Radar can also be used to detect a hook echo extending from the rear part of the storm, resulting from precipitation wrapping around the backside of the rotating updraft. Radar can also detect the debris ball from a tornado; objects lofted into the air by a tornado reflect radar waves very well.', 'The tornado season of 2011, known as the Super Outbreak, was one of the most deadly in U.S. history, with 59 tornadoes in 14 states causing more than 550 fatalities. Most of these deaths occurred in Alabama and Missouri. The three most deadly tornadoes of 2011 were the Joplin, Missouri EF5, which took 161 lives; the Hackleburg EF5, which claimed 72; and the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham EF4, whichÂ\xa0killed 65. Six of the top 10 deadliest tornadoes that year occurred in Alabama. April 27, 2011, was the deadliest tornado day in the U.S. since March 18, 1925.Â\xa0', 'From 1985 toÂ\xa02010, more tornado-related deaths in the southeast U.S. occurred in mobile homes than in any other structure. In theÂ\xa0decade before 2011, half of all fatalities occurred in mobile homes.Â\xa0Some of this is related to the fact that the Southeast inÂ\xa0general hasÂ\xa0more mobile homes than any other U.S. region.', 'A year after the 2011 Super Outbreak,Â\xa0scientists assessed 2000 adolescent survivors of theÂ\xa0tornadoesÂ\xa0for signsÂ\xa0of major depressive episodes (MDE) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Roughly 1 in 15 adolescents suffered from PTSDÂ\xa0and 1 in 13 developed MDE. Unsurprisingly, both also occurred in greater frequency when a family member had been injured. Nearly one-third of the children surveyed suffered from hyperarousalâ\x80\x94a state of tension produced by hormones released during the fight-or-flight reactionâ\x80\x94and re-experiencing (or reliving) the event.', 'Despite the continued occurrence of massive tornadoes, fatalities from these weather phenomena have declined. Until the 1930s, the average death toll from tornadoes was well above 200 per year. Since the late 1990s, the average has hovered near 50 deaths per year. Thanks to better technology, models, and data, scientists can increasingly predict conditions that are likely to produce a tornado, thus saving a greater number of people.', 'A version of this story ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71355/12-whirling-facts-about-tornadoes
172,How Barnum Brown Discovered 'T. rex' and Became Historyâs Greatest Fossil Hunter,"['paleontology', 'fossils', 'dinosaurs', 'science', 'history', 'features', 'news']","['More than 66 million years after its demise, the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen was back on its feet. Teeth the size of chefâ\x80\x99s knives lined the jaws of its skull, which stood 18 feet off the ground. Its puny arms made the rest of its frame look bulkier in comparison. The Meridian Daily Journal dubbed the carnivore â\x80\x9cthe king of all flesh eatersâ\x80\x9d when it debuted to the public in October 1915, and though its organic form had long since decayed, the prehistoric creature was still capable of inspiring fear in those who passed under its shadow.Â\xa0', 'The T. rex displayed at New York Cityâ\x80\x99s American Museum of Natural History had looked less impressive when it was discovered in Montanaâ\x80\x99s Hell Creek 13 years prior. Buried beneath sand and encased in blue sandstone, it would have resembled ordinary rock to the untrained eye. But paleontologist Barnum Brown knew he was looking at something special. He had spent most of his adult life traveling the country, coaxing the remains of extinct giants from remote hillsides. Few people alive had seen more dinosaur fossils than he, so he was confident he had stumbled upon something newâ\x80\x94a gargantuan carnivore the likes of which had never been seen outside fairytales. A three-year excavation confirmed his hunch.Â\xa0', 'The first discovered fossil of T. rex made the species an icon and ignited a cultural obsession with paleontology that has yet to fizzle out. It also cemented Barnum Brownâ\x80\x99s legacy as one of the most influential fossil hunters of all time. In a cutthroat climate that saw paleontologists and museum directors elbowing for the spotlight, that title wasnâ\x80\x99t earned easily.', 'Barnum Brown was marked for greatness from a young age. Born on a Kansas farm on February 12, 1873, the third child of Clara and William Brown went weeks without a name. Nearby Topeka was plastered with advertisements for P.T. Barnumâ\x80\x99s traveling circus at this time, as were cities throughout the Midwest. The colorful posters still loomed large in 6-year-old Frank Brownâ\x80\x99s mind when his baby brother arrived. As his parents argued about what to name their new son, Frank offered a suggestion: â\x80\x9cLetâ\x80\x99s call him Barnum.â\x80\x9d ', 'Young Barnumâ\x80\x99s life bore no resemblance to that of the enterprising circus showman, but he would live up to his name. He showed little interest in farming the familyâ\x80\x99s property and preferred combing the grounds around his home for fossils. His father ran a modest strip-mining operation on their coal-rich property, and the plows and scrapers unearthed ancient treasures. Corals and seashells from a forgotten seabed littered the landscape. Barnum collected enough fossils to stuff every drawer in the house.', 'His compulsion to collect natural wonders reflected both his namesake and the man he was destined to become. He wrote years later, â\x80\x9cThere must be something in a name, for I have always been in the show business of running a fossil menagerie.â\x80\x9d', 'In 1890, a teenage Brown defected from rural life to enroll in the University of Kansas. His studies extended beyond the classroom and into the fields where he longed to be. Paleontology was a new science at this point, with early players still figuring out the rules in real time, but Brown showed a keen instinct for locating fossils and wresting them from the earth. This earned him nicknames like â\x80\x9cMr. Bonesâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cFather of the Dinosaursâ\x80\x9d from his peers. Though the work was often dirty, Brown showed up to digs looking his best.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cHe dressed up in fur coats and wore fine clothing while on prospecting trips in the middle of nowhere because he wanted to prove to himself that he was not destined to stay in the family farm forever, but instead had become the dashing explorer of his childhood dreams,â\x80\x9d David K. Randall, author of The Monsterâ\x80\x99s Bones, tells Mental Floss. ', 'At the end of the 19th century, hundreds of extinct dinosaur species were waiting to be discoveredâ\x80\x94including T. rex. But talent alone wasnâ\x80\x99t enough to excavate these beasts. Significant cash was required to fund the expeditions, and fortunately for researchers, paleontology had become a pet interest among millionaires.Â\xa0', 'New York aristocrat Henry Fairfield Osborn became head of the American Museum of Natural Historyâ\x80\x99s Department of Vertebrate Paleontology in 1891. The son of a railroad magnate, he was positioned to use his wealth and connections to pull the museum ahead in the fossil race. Up to that point, the so-called Bone Wars had been led by rivals Edward Drinker Cope of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and Othniel Charles Marsh of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale, and AMNH was desperate to catch up. By making the institution a major player in the area, Osborn hoped to gain a reputation worthy of his social status at the same time.', 'Though he wasnâ\x80\x99t equipped to dig up fossils himself, he had a knack for finding people who were. Osborn invited Barnum Brown on a try-out expedition out west to test his skills in the field. The young paleontologist was still enrolled in college at the time, but he didnâ\x80\x99t hesitate to drop out and take the opportunity. The decision ended up paying off for both Osborn and Brown: On a dig in Wyomingâ\x80\x99s Big Horn Basin, Brown unearthed a Coryphodon skeleton that was intact save for its hind limbs, making it the most complete specimen found at the time.Â\xa0', 'With assistance from Osborn, Brown moved to New York and enrolled in a graduate program at Columbia University. In the city he met Marion Raymond, a public school teacher and the daughter of a respected lawyer. The two married, and in 1908 they had a daughter named Frances.', 'Married life didnâ\x80\x99t cure Brown of his taste for adventure. Osborn continued sending him to remote locations with the goal of recapturing their luck in Wyoming. That discovery wasnâ\x80\x99t a fluke. Over the next several years, Brown added new treasures to the museumâ\x80\x99s fledgling collection, such as the towering sauropod Diplodocus. But these fossils werenâ\x80\x99t enough for Osborn. Competing museums were amassing impressive specimens at a similar pace. With funding from Andrew Carnegie, Pittsburghâ\x80\x99s natural history museum uncovered a Diplodocus skeleton that was bigger than the one in New York, and Osborn scolded Brown for not getting to it first.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cDinosaur fossils became trophies in the eyes of [the] Andrew Carnegies of the world,â\x80\x9d Randall says, â\x80\x9ccapable of making their institutionsâ\x80\x94and by extension themselvesâ\x80\x94the most popular and important in the world.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Osborn knew the only way for AMNH to stand out was to acquire something truly extraordinaryâ\x80\x94a crown jewel that would attract visitors from around the world.Â\xa0', 'To Brown, what the world thought of his work was less important than the work itself. Preparing to leave an expedition in Patagonia in 1900, he wrote: â\x80\x9cFor many months I had been out of touch with civilization. There were no cables, and mail often reached me via Liverpool. The Spanish [â\x80\x93American] War had been fought and won, but I was happy following the life work I had chosen.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Brown and Osborn had a contentious relationship. Even after putting AMNHâ\x80\x99s paleontology department on the map, Brown continued to earn measly wages, forcing him to ask his employer for a more stable position and a higher salary. Osborn, meanwhile, had no qualms about taking full credit for Brownâ\x80\x99s accomplishments in the press. Despite these tensions, the two men were aligned on one matter: the drive to discover bigger, more awe-inspiring dinosaurs. With this goal in mind, Brown set off for a Cretaceous-era time capsule in Montana in the summer of 1902.', 'Brown knew they had to be close. After stumbling upon the remains of an unidentified carnivorous dinosaur in a rocky hillside years ago, he and his team were on the verge of freeing it from its sandstone tomb. Getting there hadnâ\x80\x99t been easy; when plows proved useless against the unyielding rock, they blasted away the surface layer with dynamite. On the hottest days, temperatures crept up to 110Â°F. The heat, combined with exhaustion and cold beers from the local saloon, made the badlands appear to shimmer on the horizon.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cIt was hot tedious work and when we completed we left a scar on Mount Sheba thirty feet long, thirty feet wide and twenty five feet deep,â\x80\x9d Brown later recounted in his memoirs. â\x80\x9cAnd worth all our effort for this dinosaur proved to be the type specimen Tyrannosaurus rex.â\x80\x9d (A â\x80\x9ctype specimenâ\x80\x9d is the specific organism on which an official scientific description of a new species is based.)', 'Its significance soon became apparent. Even with the excess rock chipped away, the fossilized pelvis weighed more than 4000 pounds. Later analysis revealed the beast had stretched up to 40 feet long and weighed between 11,000 and 15,500 pounds in life. Paleontologists had excavated large carnivorous dinosaurs in the past, but none that would have been a match for Brownâ\x80\x99s latest find. Henry Osborn christened the new species with an appropriately superlative name, combining the Greek term for â\x80\x9ctyrant lizardâ\x80\x9d and the Latin word for â\x80\x9cking.â\x80\x9d', 'Though the discovery was groundbreaking, the fossil itself left much to be desired. Only a partial skeleton was recovered, and when it arrived in New York, Osborn deemed it unfit for display. Still, he knew a more complete specimen could garner the crowds and acclaim he envisioned. He sent Brown back to Montana with the directive to one-up his once-in-a-lifetime find.', 'While other paleontologists would spend decades searching for T. rex, Brown was able to locate two more within years of digging up the initial fossil. They were also embedded in the Hell Creek Formation, and unlike the first specimen, they were in promising shape. He even found a 1000-pound skull filled with curving, serrated teethâ\x80\x94further evidence of the dinosaurâ\x80\x99s predatory nature.Â\xa0', 'After laying dormant in the ground for millions of years, T. rex would have to wait a bit longer to debut to the public. The American Museum of Natural History embarked on the painstaking process of shaving rock from fossil and rearranging the bones to recapture their living form. Little was known about how the species may have looked more than 66 million years ago, so it ended up standing taller in death than it had in life. Museum staff members mounted its vertebrae vertically, lifting its huge head too high and positioning its tail dragging. (Paleontologists now agree that T. rex walked with its spine and tail parallel to the ground.) The result was a behemoth that barely fit beneath the museumâ\x80\x99s ceiling.', 'The exhibition whipped the media into a frenzy when it opened to the public in 1915. The breathless coverage matched the speciesâ\x80\x99 hyperbolic name. â\x80\x9cSo big is the mere skeleton of the monster as it rears aloft in the museum that it dwarfs into insignificance the largest man or animal brought near to it,â\x80\x9d The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote. â\x80\x9cTyrannosaurus rex was capable of destroying any of the contemporary creatures on the globe.â\x80\x9d', 'Even as the press died down, the publicâ\x80\x99s fascination with the prehistoric carnivore stayed strong.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cMore than any other fossilâ\x80\x94and more than nearly any other object that can found in a museumâ\x80\x94the [T. rex] changed popular culture by bringing science and the concept of prehistoric life into the reach of the everyday person,â\x80\x9d Randall says. â\x80\x9cSuddenly it became understandable that these alien-like life forms once ruled Earth, and that the climate and land masses we see today may have once looked much different.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Early Hollywood cast the beast as an antagonist in films like 1918â\x80\x99s The Ghost of Slumber Mountain, 1933â\x80\x99s King Kong, and 1940â\x80\x99s Fantasia (Brown served as a consultant on the latter). The AMNH specimen was the only one on display until 1940, which meant that every T. rex depicted on film before then was indirectly or directly modeled after it.', 'Bigger carnivorous species were eventually discovered, but Tyrannosaurus rex never lost its status as King of the Dinosaurs. It reached new levels of fame in the 1990s with the publication of Michael Crichtonâ\x80\x99s Jurassic Park and Steven Spielbergâ\x80\x99s subsequent movie adaptation. Instead of the living dinosaur, both the book cover and film poster depict the silhouette of aT. rex fossil. When designing the image, Chip Kidd used AMNH 5027â\x80\x94the same specimen Barnum Brown dug up for the museum to displayâ\x80\x94as his reference.Â\xa0', 'As T. rex rose to celebrity status, its discoverer remained anonymous outside certain circles. Newspapers like The New York Times credited Osborn with the findâ\x80\x94likely at his request. If this bothered Brown, he didnâ\x80\x99t go out of his way to show it.', 'â\x80\x9cBrown, unlike Osborn, didnâ\x80\x99t seek out the spotlight and in many cases was never mentioned in the stories about his discoveries,â\x80\x9d Randall says.', 'He had bigger concerns in the years following the T. rex expeditions. In 1910, his wife Marion succumbed to a sudden illness, leaving him a widower and single father. He left his daughter in the care of Marionâ\x80\x99s parents and retreated into his work, traveling from Canada to Asia over the subsequent years.Â\xa0', 'It was in this period of his life that he found himself competing with the Sternberg family. Paleontologist Charles H. Sternberg often brought his sons George, Charles, and Levi into the field, and together they made a formidable team. Their discoveries included a mummified Edmontosaurusâ\x80\x94one of the best-preserved dinosaur specimens known to science at the time.Â\xa0', 'Though he wasnâ\x80\x99t worried about getting credit in the press, being the one to get to these fossils first mattered to Brown. Rivalries were nothing new in the paleontology world. The Bone Wars primarily fought by Cope and Marsh defined the studyâ\x80\x99s early period, with the two men resorting to destroying bones and smearing the otherâ\x80\x99s reputation. The conflict between Brown and the Sternbergs never devolved to that level, and in the heat of their competition the two parties maintained a mutual respect. George Sternberg even worked for AMNH under Brownâ\x80\x99s guidance early in his career. Brown wasnâ\x80\x99t happy to be missing out on fossils, but the friendly rivalry was a welcome motivator and distraction from his grief.', 'After discovering the most famous dinosaur of all time, a less ambitious paleontologist may have taken the opportunity to slow down. Not Barnum Brown: As he watched his aging peers transition from digs to desk jobs, he continued spending time in the field. ', 'The race to stuff museum halls with fossils petered out following World War I and the Great Depression, which required him to rethink his work. Without the funding to dig up dinosaur bones, he used his experience to find oil reservoirs for businesses with money to spend. This enabled him to work as an industrial spy for oil companies during wartime, and later as an intelligence asset for the pre-CIA Office of Strategic Services.', 'â\x80\x9cHe had the gift of reinvention that allowed him to [put] his farm life behind him, and that was a trait that propelled him into becoming a spy as well,â\x80\x9d Randall says.Â\xa0', 'Though he always treated his fossils as the main attraction, he lived up to his namesake by dabbling in show business later in life. He hosted his own weekly radio show on CBS, and when he toured the country fans lined up to meet the legendary dinosaur hunter. After being denied credit for his work for years, Brown had become one of paleontologyâ\x80\x99s first celebrities, paving the way for public-facing pop-science stars of the modern era. He never eclipsed the star power of T. rex, but few people ever would.Â\xa0', 'Additional Source: Barnum Brown: The Man Who Discovered Tyrannosaurus Rex, by Lowell Dingus and Mark A.

When it comes to cooking in the kitchen, which is truly better: gas or electric stoves? ', 'Fans of the gas stove claim it heats up faster and offers superior temperature control compared to electric ranges, making it easier to cook multiple dishes at once. On the other hand, proponents of the electric stove contend that these appliances are generally safer and easier to maintain than gas ranges. ', 'While there are definite pros and cons to each type of stove, Gothamist reports that scientists and chefs alike are now weighing in and consider electric ranges to be the best option for most homes. In this article, weâ\x80\x99ll look at the reasons why and drill deeper into the benefits and disadvantages that each type offers. ', 'Gas stoves are in more than 40 million homes across the U.S., but recent studies have shown that these appliances may be more hazardous to the environment and human health than once believed.Â\xa0', 'In a January 2022 study published in Environmental Science & Technology, researchers found that gas stoves emit a lot of methaneâ\x80\x94so much so that over a 20-year period, annual emissions from all the gas stoves in the U.S. had the same impact on the climate as the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 cars. Gas stoves also release benzene and nitrogen dioxide into the air, which could lead to respiratory diseases. In fact, a December 2022 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health suggested that more than 12 percent of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. could be linked to gas stove use. ', 'â\x80\x9cStoves leak small amounts of gas all the time, even when they are off. While these leaks are often too small to smell, they can still impact air quality and increase human health risks in our homes,â\x80\x9d said Dr. Eric Lebel, senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy and lead author of an October 2022 study on the indoor effects of unburned, natural gas emissions from household appliances.', 'Concerns over gas stove emissions are now so high that in January 2023, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced that it was looking into ways to reduce such indoor air-quality hazards and strengthen voluntary safety standards on new models. This news also came amid reports that the agency was considering a nationwide ban on gas stovesâ\x80\x94something that CPSC chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric has since debunked. â\x80\x9c[To] be clear, I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so,â\x80\x9d he said in a statement. ', 'Aside from unwanted emissions, gas rangesâ\x80\x94while often less expensive to run than electric stovesâ\x80\x94can be pricey to install, especially if you have to add a new gas line. They can also be trickier to clean, which can be a sticking point for some shoppers.', 'Compared to gas ranges, electric versions give off no gasses at all, which is one of the driving factors behind the push to replace them with electric models.Â\xa0', 'When it comes to the quality of the cooking experience, chefs are a bit more split along the gas vs. electric stove divide. Some maintain that gas cooking provides a higher-quality experience (namely, being able to cook faster and have more control over temperatures), but increasingly, others are lauding the benefits of induction ranges, a special type of electric stove that uses electromagnetism to heat up cookware more quickly than a standard coil model likely would. ', 'For professional cooks, thatâ\x80\x99s a definite benefit. Anna Rossi, chef and host of The Chefâ\x80\x99s Pantry, recently told NBC10 BostonÂ\xa0that induction stoves are simultaneously more reliable and easier to clean than their gas and basic electric counterparts.Â\xa0â\x80\x9cI find that nothing compares to induction,â\x80\x9d Rossi said. â\x80\x9cIt has such a well-dispersed energy in how it heats the pan that it is very efficient.â\x80\x9d', 'Energy efficiency is another big reason why many experts recommend induction ranges; while theyâ\x80\x99re often more expensive to purchase and install, Energy Star estimates that theyâ\x80\x99re about 5 to 10 percent more efficient than conventional electric stoves and about three times more efficient than gas models. â\x80\x9cIf the government is serious about the environment, they should subsidize induction stoves like they do with hybrid and electric cars,â\x80\x9d chef Sia Pickett told Gothamist in a recent interview. â\x80\x9cI switched to induction because I care about the environment.â\x80\x9d', 'One possible drawback of the induction stove is that certain cookware canâ\x80\x99t be used with it. Fortunately, there is a hack to test and see whether yours will work. To start, just flip your pan over and hold a magnet to the bottom to see if it sticks. If it does, your pan is ferromagnetic and can be safely used on induction stovetops.Â\xa0', ""Overall, cooking is a deeply cultural skill, and most folks often develop strong emotional connections to their preferred method. If someone learned to cook on a gas range, chances are high that they will retain a nostalgic fondness for that style. Yet for those looking to improve their indoor air quality and embrace more sustainable practices in the kitchen, electric ranges are a great alternative that's  worth considering."", 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/gas-vs-electric-stoves-which-is-better
174,The Stories Behind 20 Inventions That Changed the World | Mental Floss,"['animals', 'history', 'inventions', 'inventors', 'lists', 'news', 'space', 'toys']","['You might find it impossible to imagine a world without your smartphone, or have trouble remembering a time when Wi-Fi wasnâ\x80\x99t everywhere, but many of todayâ\x80\x99s most relied-upon technologies would not have been possibleâ\x80\x94or even dreamed ofâ\x80\x94if it werenâ\x80\x99t for the game-changing inventions that came before them. And while itâ\x80\x99s easy to take many of the marvels of design and engineering we interact with on a daily basis for grantedâ\x80\x94think toilets, seat belts, and suspension bridgesâ\x80\x94itâ\x80\x99s just as easy to overlook how a handful of more surprising inventions, like the Super Soaker or the pizza saver, have affected the world around us. From blood banks to barcodes and beyond, here are the stories behind 20 inventions that changed the world.', 'Suspension bridges are nothing new; thereâ\x80\x99s one in China that until recently used bamboo thatâ\x80\x99s at least 1000 years old, and may be over 2000. But the modern suspension bridges that came along in the 1800s were something else altogether: They were cheaper to build, easier to repair, and provided plenty of leeway in case of flooding. Eventually, the bridges allowed for passage over far larger bodies of water and could withstand violent storms and the ever-increasing weight of foot and vehicle traffic in cities (not to mention drastically cutting down travel times). In the middle of the 19th century, engineer John A. Roebling saw that the Allegheny Portage Railroad was using breakable hemp ropes, leading him to create a way to spin and manufacture wire rope, a technology Roebling would soon put toward suspension bridges. Eventually, the wire could be spun and anchored on site, which helped speed up the construction process.', 'Roeblingâ\x80\x99s innovations led to his designs for the Niagara River Gorge Bridge, the Sixth Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, and the famed Brooklyn Bridge in the second half of the 19th century. Though the Brooklyn Bridge was John Roeblingâ\x80\x99s basic design, his son, Washington, took over the project as chief engineer following his fatherâ\x80\x99s death in 1869. Then, after Washington became mostly confined to his home following a battle with decompression sickness (or â\x80\x9cthe bendsâ\x80\x9d), his wife, Emily, took on many of his responsibilities. During a time when women were kept far away from STEM fields, Emily learned about cable construction, stress analysis, and other principles of suspension bridge engineering, and was a key figure in the completion of the project.', 'Today, suspension bridges are located in all corners of the globe, allowing people to safely and easily travel across great chasms and bodies of water. And these bridges are no longer suspended only over simple riversâ\x80\x94Japanâ\x80\x99s Akashi Kaikyo Bridge stretches 12,828 feet across the Akashi Strait and features a main span that is 6527 feet long.', 'Dry and flush toilets have been around for thousands of years, and while many of us take these pieces of porcelain hardware for granted these days, thereâ\x80\x99s no doubt that life would look much differentâ\x80\x94and much worseâ\x80\x94without them. â\x80\x9cToilets are the key to a thriving, healthy society,â\x80\x9d Kimberly Worsham, sanitation expert and founder of FLUSH (Facilitated Learning for Universal Sanitation and Hygiene), tells Mental Floss. Having a designated place to do your business cuts back on outbreaks of infectious diseases like cholera and typhoidâ\x80\x94both rampant in urban areas before flush toilets (and indoor plumbing and sewers) were widely used. And in the case of dry toilets, the waste deposited there can be processed for agricultural use.', 'Typically, people date the modern flush toilet to John Harington, godson to Queen Elizabeth I, but there were flush toilets well before he got involved (one in Knossos, which dates back to the 16th century BCE, was even connected to a sewer). â\x80\x9cFlush toilets like his had been available to Western Europe during the Roman Empire, but after Rome fell, Europe essentially resorted to sh***ing outside again,â\x80\x9d Worsham says. â\x80\x9cAll of those systems fell into disrepair.â\x80\x9d (Other areas of the world, like East Asia and areas of the Middle East, still used toilets even as Western Europe went backward.)', 'The options available at the time Harington was innovating were chamber pots, garderobesâ\x80\x94which Worsham describes as â\x80\x9cdreadful closets with holes in the groundâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94or going to the bathroom outside. Harington wanted to bring the toilet back in and make going to the bathroom a more comfortable experience, but his invention left a lot to be desired: Instead of connecting to a sewer, it had a pipe that went straight down into a lower chamber that would eventually need to be emptied by some unlucky person. Even worse, its design meant that the toxic, flammable gases released when urine and poop decompose could come wafting back up, creating potentially deadly situations. It didnâ\x80\x99t catch on; Harington built just a handful of models.', 'Then, in 1775, a Scottish watchmaker named Alexander Cumming developed the S-trap, a piece of plumbing that attaches to the back of the toilet. â\x80\x9cThis was revolutionary because it used water in the trap to keep the toxic gasses from getting back into the home and the poo and pee from easily sliding back into the toilet,â\x80\x9d Worsham says. â\x80\x9cOnce Cumming patented his design, we had something like a flush toilet renaissance.â\x80\x9d Tinkering with toilets commenced in earnest, with people like Thomas Crapper (who, according to Worsham, â\x80\x9ccreated a killer marketing campaign for toiletsâ\x80\x9d) getting involved. Once materials to make toilets became cheaper, they became more common, and the world got much safer. â\x80\x9cWe saw mortality rates decline,â\x80\x9d Worsham says. â\x80\x9cIt also made our living spaces far less sh***yâ\x80\x94literally.â\x80\x9d Bodily waste deposited into flush toilets went into sewers or septic tanks, which meant it wasnâ\x80\x99t on the street or in drinking water.', 'That said, thereâ\x80\x99s still a long way to go to make sure everyone has access to a toilet: According to Worsham, â\x80\x9c1 in 4 people in the world lack access to basic toilets, and 1 in 2 lacks access to safely managed toiletsâ\x80\x94toilets where the waste is never put back into the environment untreated.â\x80\x9d Without toilets, people are sicker and miss both work and school more often, which can lead to poverty traps and inequality. Thankfully, toilet tinkering hasnâ\x80\x99t stopped: â\x80\x9cThere have been some really great projects by social enterprises and non-governmental organizations in different parts of the world working to build newer, better, more environmentally-friendly toilets,â\x80\x9d Worsham says. â\x80\x9cThereâ\x80\x99s also been some really neat innovation in integrating fecal waste from the toilets with organic wasteâ\x80\x94a.k.a. food scrapsâ\x80\x94and treating them to create great agricultural products like fertilizer and animal feed. Weâ\x80\x99re thinking circular economies here, and itâ\x80\x99s exciting.â\x80\x9d', 'Though many of todayâ\x80\x99s kids didnâ\x80\x99t know what a Walkman was until they saw Chris Prattâ\x80\x99s Peter Quill flaunt one in 2014â\x80\x99sÂ\xa0Guardians of the Galaxy, they pay unofficial homage to the device every time they play a song on their smartphone. Transistor radios had been around since the 1950s, but it was Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka who really revolutionized the idea of playing whatever you want wherever you are (provided that you had the cassette tape on hand). For Ibuka, he really wanted something he could use to listen to music on flights. The Sony Walkman debuted in Japan in 1979 (and the U.S. in 1980) and quickly became the It Girl of the â\x80\x9980s. The Walkman itself was compact, lightweight, and portable, and so were its headphones. As new devices debuted over the yearsâ\x80\x94from Sonyâ\x80\x99s Discman to Appleâ\x80\x99s iPod to smartphones and the Bluetooth headphones of todayâ\x80\x94the focus on those qualities never wavered.', 'By the end of the 19th century, bicycles were offering women a relatively cheap, easy form of independence. Their movements, and the clothing they wore, became less restricted. Decades later, a new item would hit the market and further revolutionize womenâ\x80\x99s rights: the Pill.', ""Hormonal birth control pills (often shortened to just the Pill) werenâ\x80\x99t the first oral contraceptive; people had long relied on various concoctions, such as drinking mercury or toxic pennyroyal. By the early 20th century, a push for better contraceptives was rising in the U.S.â\x80\x94Margaret Sanger opened Americaâ\x80\x99s first birth control clinic in 1916, for example, though it was raided and shut down. Work on a contraceptive pill didnâ\x80\x99t begin until the 1950s. A biologist named Gregory Goodwin Pincus and a gynecologist named John Rock, with encouragement and funding from Sanger and wealthy philanthropist Katharine McCormick, teamed up to develop a â\x80\x9cmagic pillâ\x80\x9d that could prevent pregnancy. â\x80\x9cI would argue that effective contraception was probably in the whole of the 20th century the most important change for women,â\x80\x9d Linda Gordon, author of Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, told Allure."", 'When the Pill first hit the market in 1957, it was only approved to help regulate menstruation [PDF]; even after the FDA approved the Pill for contraceptive use in 1960, it still wasnâ\x80\x99t readily available. In some U.S. states, it remained illegal for unmarried women to purchase the pill until 1972. Oral contraceptives have evolved since their original debut; today, there are many brands on the market, and people can now choose from a variety of monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic options, which provide varying amounts of estrogen and progestin.', 'The creation of the Pill did more than give women control over their sexual health and fertilityâ\x80\x94it allowed them to choose to marry later, seek additional education, and advance in their careers. As Vanessa Grigoriadis wrote in New York magazine, â\x80\x9cThese days, womenâ\x80\x99s twenties are as free and fabulous as they can be, a time of boundless freedom and experimentation, of easily trying on and discarding identities, careers, partners. The Pill, which is the most popular form of contraception in the U.S., is still the symbol of that freedom.â\x80\x9d', 'For decades, squirt guns were flimsy pieces of plastic that could barely muster enough power to water a houseplant. Then the first Super Soakerâ\x80\x94then called the Power Drencherâ\x80\x94hit the market in 1990, bringing along with it a Schwarzenegger-esque machismo and a sophisticated air-pressure system that promised to drench unsuspecting targets from far further than previous water guns. The allure of wreaking havoc at family get-togethers and school functions was apparently too much for kids to pass up, and more than 2 million guns flew off the shelves in its debut year. Al Davis, the former executive vice president of Larami, wrote in his book Super Soaker that â\x80\x9cThe deliveries would come into the stores, and the clerks wouldnâ\x80\x99t even have time to put them on the shelves. Theyâ\x80\x99d just take them out of the boxes and sell them to the kids waiting in line for them.â\x80\x9d', 'In its first 25 years on the market, more than 175 different variations of the high-powered water gun were released, racking up over $1 billion in sales in the process. Hasbro bought Larami and the Super Soaker brand in 1995, and to this day, the company continues to release bigger models that promise to unleash more water-fueled mayhem every summer.', 'When the Strong National Museum of Play inducted the Super Soaker into its National Toy Hall of Fame in 2015, former Curator Patricia Hogan noted, â\x80\x9c[The] Super Soaker had a big impact on neighborhood play. The small squirt guns of the past had required close-in work to engage the opposition. The long, drenching reach of Johnsonâ\x80\x99s invention requires a quick retreat from a soggy assault or a good chase, meaning that kids with Super Soakers do some serious sprinting. Calculating the distance to target and the physics of velocity and arc requires kids to use their brains. Contemplating strategies and tactics and puzzling out plans forces kids to analyze the best approaches to triumphal ends. And if kids get soaked in the process? Itâ\x80\x99s all good clean fun.â\x80\x9d', 'None of this would have been possible if not for the outside-the-box thinking of former NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson. He got the idea for the Super Soaker while testing a new type of heat pump he had created that used water as a coolant in the early 1980s. While the heat pump worked fine, he also realized it was pretty fun to shoot concentrated streams of water from the pump across his bathroom.', 'â\x80\x9cI was having trouble getting people to understand the hard science inventions I had like a heat pump or the digital measuring instrument,â\x80\x9d Johnson told Forbes. â\x80\x9cI thought the toy was something anyone could look at and appreciate.â\x80\x9d', 'Though Johnson holds over 100 patents and worked on NASAâ\x80\x99s Galileo mission to Jupiter, his reinvention of the water gun, from 29-cent novelty to summer staple, is something that generations of kidsâ\x80\x94and some unwitting bystandersâ\x80\x94will never forget.', 'Less than a century ago, patients requiring a blood transfusion were in a race against time. There was no organized network for people to donate blood, and because blood was difficult to preserve, there was no way to store it for future use. Patients had to find their own blood donors before it was too late.', 'In 1937, after devising a technique for preserving blood for up to 10 days, physician Bernard Fantus set up the nationâ\x80\x99s first â\x80\x9cblood bankâ\x80\x9d at Chicagoâ\x80\x99s Cook County Hospital. People could make â\x80\x9cdepositsâ\x80\x9d of their own blood for their own use or to be given to others with matching blood types.', 'At about the same time, surgeon Charles R. Drew figured out a method for separating plasma from whole blood, and found that if whole blood wasnâ\x80\x99t necessary, blood transfusions could be successfully performed with plasma alone. Plasma could be dried for long-term storage in blood banks. As World War II decimated Europe, Drew and the American Red Cross launched a groundbreaking program to collect donated plasma in the U.S. and ship it to Britain, essentially creating a national system for blood donation. During the war, he collaborated with the Red Cross to set up â\x80\x9cbloodmobilesâ\x80\x9dâ\x80\x94mobile blood donation centers that made sustaining blood banks more practical. Today, about 13.6 million units of whole blood and red blood cells are collected in the U.S. each year, saving countless lives.', 'When Lyman Spitzer proposed the invention of a space telescope in the 1940s, humans could look at our universe only through land-based instruments. Earthâ\x80\x99s atmosphere acted like a veil between the land-based telescopes and space, blurring images and hindering detection of far-off celestial phenomena. Spitzerâ\x80\x99s research paved the way for the Hubble Space Telescope, the first space-based major optical telescope, launched in 1990 and named for the American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble.', 'Over its three decades in orbit, Hubble has determined the age of the universe (13.8 billion years), accurately measured the distance to a neighboring galaxy, and spotted numerous moons and exoplanets, in addition to revealing the beauty of the universe through stunning photographs. â\x80\x9cThe Hubble space telescope has brought about a visual revolution, more significant than any recent work of art in transforming the way we see ourselves and the cosmos,â\x80\x9d art critic Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian. This year, NASA is scheduled to launch the James Webb Space Telescope, the largest and most technologically advanced space telescope ever built, to unravel more secrets of space.', ""The pizza industry has undergone numerous innovations in recent decades, but one element that has remained largely the same is the box your pie comes in. Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan changed the game in the early 1960s when he worked with Triad Containers in Detroit to develop the modern pizza box. Prior to this, pizzas were delivered in bags or paperboard bakery boxes. These containers were flimsy and often crumpled under the intense heat of the pie before they reached their destinations. Dominoâ\x80\x99s corrugated cardboard containers were much more durable. They withstood grease and kept pizzas warm while releasing steam through strategically placed openings. Most importantly, the sturdy boxes were stackable, opening the door to mass deliveries."", 'But there was one area where the simple design fell short: The top of the box sometimes collapsed and stuck to the top of the pizza. The answer to this issue was the pizza saver, which Carmela Vitale patented in 1985. Shaped like a miniature patio table, the plastic device keeps the box lid separate from the pizza, thus keeping the cheese and toppings intact throughout the delivery journey. Vitale was a city council memberâ\x80\x94not a pizza salespersonâ\x80\x94but she had eaten enough delivery pizza to notice a problem and come up with an ingenious solution.', 'One fall evening in 1895, Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen, a German physics professor, was experimenting with the conduction of electricity through low-pressure gases when he accidentally discovered a mysterious ray capable of making a chemical-coated screen fluoresce a few yards away. He went on to put objects between the tube and the screen to see the shadows they producedâ\x80\x94and when he tried it with a hunk of lead, he saw shadows of not just the lead but the bones in his hand. Further experimentation showed that the screen could be replaced by a photographic plateâ\x80\x94and the X-ray was born.', ""RÃ¶ntgen named it X-strahlenâ\x80\x94strahlen being German for â\x80\x9cbeamâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9cray,â\x80\x9d and X being used in mathematics to indicate an unknown quantity [PDF]. RÃ¶ntgen's discovery revolutionized the way doctors detect disease and injury, from breast cancer to broken bones. Today, X-rays are also used to find cracks in everything from aircraft wings to nuclear reactorsâ\x80\x94helping make the modern world quite a bit safer. â\x80\x9cThanks to [RÃ¶ntgen's] invisible light,â\x80\x9d radiologist Richard Gunderman wrote in The Conversation, â\x80\x9cwe now operate with a much deeper understanding of the universe we inhabit, the molecules and cells of which we are composed[,] and the diseases that threaten our lives.â\x80\x9d"", 'The first â\x80\x9cwildlife camsâ\x80\x9d were invented by Pennsylvania Congressman and photography enthusiast George Shiras around the end of the 19th century. He got the idea from a hunting technique used by the Ojibwa tribe called jacklighting, in which a fire is built in a pan and placed in the front part of a canoe while the hunter sits in the bow. â\x80\x9cThe glow makes it possible to distinguish the animal, whose attention is caught by the flames, causing it to stand still with an expectant air,â\x80\x9d Sonia Voss, who curated an exhibition of Shirasâ\x80\x99s photographs, told National Geographic. â\x80\x9cAt the rear of the canoe, the hunter, cast into the shadows, only needs to aim between the animalâ\x80\x99s eyes, which reflect the flames and stand out like two bright beacons in the night. In the photographic version, the fire is replaced by a kerosene lamp and the trigger of the rifle by the shutter release of the camera.â\x80\x9d Later, Shiras graduated to cameras equipped with flash and tripped by a string.', 'Today, critter cameras have evolved to be so light that they can be strapped to marine life, are battery powered so they can be left in nature for months at a time, and have been attached to robots to get closer to dangerous creatures than ever before, giving us an unprecedented look into the lives of the animals we share the planet with, and the world they inhabitâ\x80\x94and helping us make plenty of scientific discoveries along the way.

Stoudt worked at Green River Ordnance Plant packing and inspecting boxes of ammunition. The boxes were sealed with paper tape, dipped in wax, and had a tab to open them. Stoudt noticed that the boxes had a flaw: The tape was flimsy and tabs often tore off, which meant that soldiers couldnâ\x80\x99t quickly open the boxes when they were under fire. Why not create a cloth-based waterproof tape to seal the boxes? She asked her supervisors, but they werenâ\x80\x99t supportive, so she escalated the matter â\x80¦ straight to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. â\x80\x9cI suggested we use a strong cloth tape to close seams, and make tab of same,â\x80\x9d she wrote. â\x80\x9cIt worked fine, I showed it to different government inspectors they said it was all right, but I could never get them to change tape.â\x80\x9d', ""The president sent her letter to the War Production Board, her idea was approved, and the rest is history.

It was the first time an item with a barcode had ever been purchased.', ""The inventors behind this marvel of commerce were N. Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver, who envisioned a system of lines that could identify consumer products by using encoded information read by an optical scanner. It all started when Silver, a grad student at Drexel, overheard the president of a local food chain talking to the dean about the need to automatically obtain product information. The dean wasn't interested in pursuing the idea, but Silver mentioned it to his colleague Woodland, who thought the idea had so much promise that he quit his job and moved to Florida to pursue it. Ultimately, Woodland devised a system inspired by Morse code (which he had used as a Boy Scout) as well as the movie sound systems of the 1920s.

Other innovators, like 19th century aviator George Cayley, recognized a need to keep humans from being ejected out of planes and other moving vehicles. But it was Bohlin, a Volvo engineer, who sought to improve upon the two-point lap belts, which could sometimes do more harm than good in the event of an accident. (At high speeds, the belts were capable of causing internal injuries.) By stabilizing the torso with a shoulder strap, drivers and passengers were kept in place without resorting to the more burdensome four-point belts worn by pilots or an earlier Y-shaped belt placed over the stomach. In what could only be described as an act of corporate selflessness, Volvo allowed any car manufacturer to duplicate the belt.

In the 1940s, George de Mestral and his dog returned from a hunting trip covered in burdock burrs. Intrigued, de Mestral whipped out his microscope to find out what, exactly, made the burrs stick. He discovered that the burrs were covered in little hooks, and that provided de Mestral, a serial inventor, with a burst of inspiration: If he could create a fabric that mimicked the burrsâ\x80\x99 hooks, and combine it with fabric loops those hooks could latch into, heâ\x80\x99d have a middle ground between fasteners like buttons and zippers.', 'It took him some time to find a manufacturer to create his fabric; many didnâ\x80\x99t think it could be done.

After early tests with rollers, burlap, and calcium chloride brine, Carrier hit on a device that sent chilled water through heating coils. The system was installed later that same summer at the printing plant alongside fans, perforated steam pipes, and other accouterments. It was a huge success, and reportedly had the same cooling effect as 108,000 pounds of ice per day.', ""Carrier's invention was sold everywhere from flour mills to razor factories, and air-conditioning went on to reshape both architecture (by allowing for skyscrapers where people didn't broil on top floors) and nations, making the development of modern metropolises in sun-scorched places like Singapore, Shanghai, the Sun Belt, and Dubai possible. It also, of course, made everyday life more pleasant (and productive) for millions, if not billions. Ironically, the large amount of energy air conditioners consume has contributed to climate change, making the need for artificial cool air more vital than ever. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s not a matter of going back to the past.

Two years later, Tesla applied for his patent in the United States.', 'Marconi and Teslaâ\x80\x99s paths converged in 1900, when Marconi applied for a patent in the U.S.â\x80\x94which was denied because Teslaâ\x80\x99s had been approved earlier that year.', 'Undaunted, Marconi continued to apply, and in 1904, the U.S. declared him to be the creator of the radio. This, along with the fact that Marconi had won a Nobel Prize for the technology, enraged Tesla. In 1915, he sued Marconi for patent infringement, but lacked the financial resources to pursue the case.', 'But beyond the courtroom drama, radio was already at work transforming the world. In 1910, it helped catch Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen, a man who was accused of killing his wife and escaping to Canada on a ship with his lover; he was caught thanks to Marconiâ\x80\x99s wireless telegraph, which sent radio waves, and a very clever ship captain. On August 31, 1920, the first radio news program was broadcast by a station in Detroit, and the first ad played on the radio in 1922, changing the world of advertising. Radio was also used during both World Wars.', 'From protests, music, famous speeches, and political unrest, the radio has broadcast many iconic moments and connected the world in a way Marconi and Tesla probably never imagined. Some have gone so far as to say that radio changed everything; as Jack Lule wrote in his book, Understanding Media and Culture, the radio became â\x80\x9can instrument of social cohesion as it brought together members of different classes and backgrounds to experience the world as a nation.â\x80\x9d', 'As for who came out on top in the radio patent war?

Like zoos, aquariums can help with conservation efforts and protect endangered speciesâ\x80\x94and like zoos, they can be controversial, as we debate how humane it is to keep large marine mammals like dolphins, orcas, and beluga whales in tanks much smaller than their natural environments. Still, many aquariums arenâ\x80\x99t just for entertainment, but are also focused on exactly what Villepreux-Power was when created an aquarium in the first place: studying and learning.', 'Lighting a home used to be a hazardous experience: Open flames on candles and in fireplaces could set things ablaze.

In the first half of the 19th century, a series of improvements were madeâ\x80\x94so much so that in the 1840s later-Sir William Grove was able to give a lecture fully illuminated by electric light. But the light was exceedingly expensive, up to 4 shillings an hour (16 pounds or $22 in todayâ\x80\x99s money) and early lightbulbs themselves were both expensive to make and unreliable.', 'There wasnâ\x80\x99t a breakthrough until 1878, when chemist Joseph Swan replaced the expensive platinum filament with a cheaper carbonized paper one that also had longevity. Edison demonstrated his lightbulb in 1879, one year after Swan. After a long patent infringement lawsuit, the two decided to combine forces and formed the company Edison-Swan United. Later in life, Edison would choose his lighting system as his greatest invention.', 'Even Edison and Swanâ\x80\x99s bulb wasnâ\x80\x99t perfect, however, and many scientists continued to improve on its designâ\x80\x94including patent expert Lewis Latimer, who streamlined and improved the carbon filament by encasing it in cardboard instead of bamboo, an innovation that allowed for longer-lasting bulbs.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s not hyperbole to say that the modern lightbulb changed how society functioned. Beyond making the home safer, it helped cut back on health problems created by things like gas fumes and smoke inhalation, paved the way for longer working hours, impacted building design, and kicked off the creation of massive infrastructure like the electric grid. Lightbulbs went into everything from cars to airplanes to trains, increasing the rate of travelâ\x80\x94and making it much safer. And the lightbulb has left its mark symbolically, too. â\x80\x9cEven though this invention, Edisonâ\x80\x99s bulb, is 135 years old at this point,â\x80\x9d Ernest Freeberg, author of The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America, said in 2015, â\x80\x9cwe still use [it] as the universal symbol for a great idea, for a stroke of inventive genius, for this Eureka moment.â\x80\x9d Today, scientists work on improving the lightbulb every year, leading to more energy-efficient bulbsâ\x80\x94and joining the long line of scientists and engineers whose bright ideas have changed history.', 'A version of this story ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/648542/inventions-changed-world

There have probably been millions of attempts to split the cookie evenly, with an equal amount of crÃ¨me filling on both sides.', 'According to cookie science, this is all but impossible.', 'As Food & Wine reports, in a 2022 paper published in Physics of Fluids, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) took a closer look at manual manipulation of the Oreo and whether any one specific twisting technique could produce the ideal division of ingredients. (As most know, the classic Oreo consists of two chocolate wafers sandwiching vanilla crÃ¨me filling.) While seemingly frivolous, the study falls under rheology, or how non-Newtonian material flows when subjected to outside forces.', 'In order to pursue an answer, a 3D-printed device dubbed the â\x80\x9cOreometerâ\x80\x9d was created that could repeat multiple ways of separating the wafers. The crÃ¨me â\x80\x9cbehavesâ\x80\x9d differently depending on how one approaches the counter-rotation of the cookies.

Trying all conceivable twisting configurations as well as different varieties of Oreos to achieve what the paper describes as â\x80\x9cpostmortem crÃ¨me distribution,â\x80\x9d none resulted in the crÃ¨me being split in half so it was distributed across the surface of each wafer. At best, the crÃ¨me separated into a half-moon shape on each, resulting in a wafer that was half-bare.', 'The paper indicates that a possible reason for this phenomenon is in how the Oreo is manufactured: The filling is applied to the bottom wafer, then topped off with a second wafer. Because the filling makes surface contact with the bottom for a moment longer, it tends to adhere more tightly to it, making any kind of equal distribution unlikely. Achieving the half-moon result tends to happen with Oreos that are older.', 'If manufacturer Nabisco wanted more equitable crÃ¨me separation, the paper speculates that adding more texture to the wafer could help.', 'The MIT team was also able to gauge the amount of torque needed to twist an Oreo apart.

It might even be a sign the cheese has matured and is therefore tastier. But itâ\x80\x99s also remarkably similar in appearance to mold. So how can you tell the difference? Calcium lactate crystals are going to feel slightly coarse, more like sand. Mold will be soft and is more likely to stick up from the surface of the cheese than the lactate, which is flat. Fondling the cheese should give you some indication of which is which.', 'You can also try scraping it with a knife. If it flakes off, itâ\x80\x99s probably calcium lactate. If it just disintegrates, itâ\x80\x99s probably mold.', 'Other types of cheese can harbor similar growths. Italian, Swiss, and Dutch cheeses may have visible Lactobacillus helveticus, which is added to helped create amino acids for flavor. The bacteria spurs the development of tyrosine, which also appears as white crystals as cheese loses moisture. Unlike calcium lactate, tyrosine is usually found on the inside, not the surface, of cheese.', 'In the event your cheese is actually growing mold, you can never go wrong by simply throwing it out. But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it should be safe to cut mold out of hard cheeses and consume the remainder. Be sure to cut at least 1 inch around the moldy area and donâ\x80\x99t let the knife come in contact with the growth. Mold in any soft foods (bread, yogurt) means it canâ\x80\x99t be locally contained and should be discarded.', '[h/t Mashed]', ""Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

179,The Surprising Science Behind Why People Dip Fries in Milkshakes,"['science', 'food', 'news']","['Whether itâ\x80\x99s mayo, ketchup, or gravy, French fries are usually served with something to dip them in. But diners have been known to go rogue and make their own dipping sauces out of whatever they can find. Such cases of culinary ingenuity led to the marriage of milkshakes and fries, one of oddestâ\x80\x94and somehow, most deliciousâ\x80\x94pairings in the fast food world. It seems to go against logic, but the combinationâ\x80\x99s appeal is backed by the science of taste.', 'Though theyâ\x80\x99re listed on different sections of the menu, milkshakes and French fries make more sense together than you might assume. Many famous food pairingsâ\x80\x94like chicken and waffles, maple and bacon, and chocolate and pretzelsâ\x80\x94combine salty and sweet. This pairing stimulates taste buds that arenâ\x80\x99t active in the presence of sugar alone. According to a 2011 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, sweet and salty foods activate sugar receptors known as SGLT1 on the tongueâ\x80\x99s sweet taste cells. Thanks to these receptors, salt enhances sweetness rather than clashing with it or canceling it out.Â\xa0', 'Fries and milkshakes also have the hot-and-cold dynamic on their side. Like distinct flavors layered into a dish, contrasting temperatures fire up different parts of our brain, leading to a more interestingâ\x80\x94and more pleasantâ\x80\x94eating experience. As Thrillist explains, this is why ice cream is often paired with warm foods, like apple pie, hot fudge, and fresh-baked brownies.', 'The physiology of taste is just one factor that determines the foods we love. Culture and peer pressure also play a huge role, which is why some flavors embraced in certain parts of the world are reviled in others. Dipping French fries in milkshakes is something many people start doing as children. Because the items arenâ\x80\x99t listed together on the menu, kids learn to put them together from people in their social circles, like a parent, older sibling, or the captain of their soccer team. This encourages them to open their minds to the otherwise unusual matchup.Â\xa0', 'Though they didnâ\x80\x99t come up with it themselves, many businesses have embraced the off-menu combo. McDonaldâ\x80\x99s and Wendyâ\x80\x99s have both promoted dipping fries in milkshakes (or Frostys, in Wendyâ\x80\x99s case) on social media.

180,DNA Analysis of Beethoven's Hair Reveals New Clues About His Death,"['music', 'history', 'science', 'news']","['Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was arguably the worldâ\x80\x99s first rock star. His sensational compositions electrified audiences. Like many other musical geniuses, his life was also fraught with a lot of unanswered questions. Thanks to new DNA analysis, historians might be closer to getting some answers.', 'A paper published in Current Biology looked at locks of the pianistâ\x80\x99s hair, which have survived through history in the hands of private collectors. The hope was that genetic analysis might provide some clues about the composerâ\x80\x99s health struggles. Famously, Beethoven suffered from hearing loss that grew worse later in life, though no diagnosis of what caused the loss was ever made in his lifetime. (Childhood infections with typhus or smallpox are possibilities, though never proven.) Beethoven tried a number of home remedies, including almond oil and leeches, to little avail. He also developed gastrointestinal problems as well as liver disease, the latter of which may have contributed to his death at age 56.', 'Using five hair samples confirmed to be from Beethoven, scientists examined his DNA for possible disease markers. A total of 10 feet of hair was examined. They discovered Beethoven had genetic risk factors for liver disease as well as a hepatitis B infection, both of which were likely factors in his demise. (Beethoven was said to be a heavy drinker, as well.)', 'Nothing was found that could explain his hearing loss, which led to his being functionally Deaf by age 48. Nor was there any indication of what could have caused his complaints of stomach issues, though lactose intolerance and celiac disease were ruled out.', 'Researchers also discovered that Beethovenâ\x80\x99s DNA was an incomplete match for his known living relatives in Belgium. This could be the result of an extramarital affair on Beethovenâ\x80\x99s fatherâ\x80\x99s side of the family.', 'Before his death, Beethoven pleaded with his family to have doctors try to determine the cause of his health issues.

181,Why Does Squinting Help You See Better?,"['big questions', 'eyes', 'the body']","['Weâ\x80\x99ve all been there: Youâ\x80\x99re struggling to see something properly, so you narrow your eyes and somehow squint the world into slightly tiring clarity. But when you really think about it, thereâ\x80\x99s something counterintuitive about squinting. Why does using less of your eye help you see something more clearly?', 'Contrary to the common assumption that youâ\x80\x99re â\x80\x9csquishing your eyeballsâ\x80\x9d into working better, squinting does nothing of the sortâ\x80\x94which, if you think about it for even a second, is a good thing. If squinting was the ocular equivalent of going to town on a stress ball, weâ\x80\x99d all be in a lot of trouble.', 'But hereâ\x80\x99s why it does make sense: Your lens, on the front of your eye, is constantly changing shape in order to focus on objects both near and far. Squinting can offer a bit of an assist to this process, temporarily reshaping the lens further to help focus light where it needs to go. But where squinting comes into its own is in reducing the amount of light going into your eye.Â\xa0', 'To see well, we need light to be focused by the lens to hit the retinaâ\x80\x94which is located at the back of the eyeâ\x80\x94as precisely as possible. There are limits to how well we can do this, particularly in challenging light conditions, or when our lenses arenâ\x80\x99t in great shape. This applies to a lot of us, as our lenses change as we age.', 'According to the Cornell Center for Materials Research, â\x80\x9cAs we get older, the lens of the eye becomes harder and cannot focus light as well as it used to. Also, some people have eyes that are slightly longer from front to back, which can make the light not focus correctly. By squinting people are actually changing the shape of their eye, just ever so little, so that the light focuses correctly on the retina.â\x80\x9d', 'In other words: A less-than-perfect lens can, to put it incredibly simply, let too much light into your eye. Like narrowing the aperture on a camera, narrowing your eyes with your eyelids reduces this interference and only allows light to come in nearer the center of the lens, allowing for a more focused concentration of light on the retina. This is sometimes called the pinhole effect.', 'Also, contrary to some beliefs, squinting does not damage your eyesightâ\x80\x94though doing it a lot can be a symptom of failing eyesight. However, you do blink less when squinting, so doing it for protracted periods of timeâ\x80\x94squinting at a computer screen all day, for instanceâ\x80\x94can lead to eye strain or dry eye. ', 'Itâ\x80\x99s one thing to occasionally squint in order to make out something far away, or to be able to read the small print on a menu in a dimly-lit restaurant.

182,Why Do the Bubbles in a Pint of Guinness Beer Sink?,"['beer', 'big questions', 'Glass', 'Guinness']","['Thereâ\x80\x99s something soothing about watching the tiny, golden bubbles rush to the top of the glass after pouring a cold beer. Unless, of course, your brew of choice is Guinness or some other stout, in which case the bubbles do the reverse, making their way to the bottom of your pint glass. This phenomenon has long been puzzling beer drinkers. Itâ\x80\x99s easy to see why bubbles would float to the top of a lager or aleâ\x80\x94the air is lighter than the surrounding liquid, after all. So how come stout, a beer thatâ\x80\x99s definitely heavier than the bubbles it contains, produces this backwards effect?', 'The answer can be traced to the shape of the glass. In 2012, Irish mathematicians published a study outlining the effects the iconic Guinness vessel has on the trajectory of beer bubbles post-pour. What they found is that stout bubbles behave differently depending on where they are in the glass: Bubbles in the middle rise up to the surface with nothing to block their path, while bubbles along the sloping walls experience drag and clump together. When the bubbles reach the top and crowd at the head, some liquid gets pushed to the sides, which in turn pushes down the bubbles sticking to the wall. This creates a current of beer pulling down the bubbles, then circulating back upwards again once it hits the bottom.', 'This same occurrence can be witnessed with lighter beers, but itâ\x80\x99s much more exaggerated in stouts. In addition to carbon dioxide, most stouts contain nitrogen, a gas that takes longer to dissolve in liquid. Nitrogen bubbles are also smaller, making them more susceptible to drag.', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s an easy way to prove to your friends at the bar that the Guinness effect is more than just an optical illusion. Instead of ordering your stout in the traditional receptacle have it served to you in a tall, cylindrical glass. If the beer is poured into the glass while itâ\x80\x99s tilted at an angle, you should be able to see the bubbles rise to the surface in the upper part of the glass and sink beneath the surface in the lower part. In this experiment the bottom of the glass mimics a pint glass while the higher portion acts as an anti-pint (or upside down pint) glass, which has the opposite impact on the bubblesâ\x80\x99 movement.', ""Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

Her long list of accolades is proof of her far-reaching influence, but not every stride she made in the fields of chemistry, physics, and medicine was recognized with an award. Here are some facts you might not know about the iconic researcher.', 'BORN', 'DIED', 'November 7, 1867, Warsaw, modern Poland', 'July 4, 1934, Sallanches, France', 'Maria SkÅ\x82odowska was the fifth and youngest child of two Polish educators. Her parents placed a high value on learning and insisted that all their childrenâ\x80\x94including their daughtersâ\x80\x94receive a quality education at home and at school. Maria received extra science training from her father, and when she graduated from high school at age 15, she was first in her class.', ""After collecting her high school diploma, Maria had hoped to study at the University of Warsaw with her sister, Bronia. Because the school didn't accept women, the siblings instead enrolled at the Flying University, a Polish college that welcomed female students. It was still illegal for women to receive higher education at the time, so the institution was constantly changing locations to avoid detection from authorities. In 1891, Maria moved to Paris to live with her sister, where she enrolled at the Sorbonne to continue her education."", 'In 1903, Marie Curie made history when she won the Nobel Prize in physics with her husband, Pierre, and with physicist Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity, making her the first woman to receive the honor. The second Nobel Prize she took home in 1911 was even more historic: With that win in the chemistry category, she became the first person to win the award twice. And she remains the only person to ever receive Nobel Prizes for two different sciences.', 'The second Nobel Prize Marie Curie received recognized her discovery and research of two elements: radium and polonium. The former element was named for the Latin word for ray and the latter was a nod to her home country, Poland.', ""When Marie and Pierre won their Nobel Prize in 1903, their daughter IrÃ¨ne was only 6 years old. She would grow up to follow in her parentsâ\x80\x99 footsteps by jointly winning the Nobel Prize for chemistry with her husband, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Joliot-Curie, in 1935. They were recognized for their discovery of â\x80\x9cartificialâ\x80\x9d radioactivity, a breakthrough made possible by IrÃ¨neâ\x80\x99s parents years earlier. Marie and Pierreâ\x80\x99s other son-in-law, Henry Labouisse, who married their younger daughter, Ã\x88ve Curie, accepted a Nobel Prize for Peace on behalf of UNICEF, of which he was the executive director, in 1965. This brought the familyâ\x80\x99s total up to five. (Ã\x88ve Curie Labouisse was an accomplished journalist, newspaper publisher, French Resistance advocate during World War II, and her mother's biographer.)"", 'The research that won Marie Curie her first Nobel Prize required hours of physical labor. In order to prove they had discovered new elements, she and her husband had to produce numerous examples of them by breaking down ore into its chemical components. Their regular labs werenâ\x80\x99t big enough to accommodate the process, so they moved their work into an old shed behind the school where Pierre worked. According to Curie, the space was a hothouse in the summer and drafty in the winter, with a glass roof that didnâ\x80\x99t fully protect them from the rain. After the famed German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald visited the Curiesâ\x80\x99 shed to see the place where radium was discovered, he described it as being â\x80\x9ca cross between a stable and a potato shed, and if I had not seen the worktable and items of chemical apparatus, I would have thought that I [had] been played a practical joke.â\x80\x9d', ""When Marie Curie was performing her most important research on radiation in the early 20th century, she had no idea of the effects it would have on her health. It wasn't unusual for her to walk around her lab with bottles of polonium and radium in her pockets. She even described storing the radioactive material out in the open in her autobiography. â\x80\x9cOne of our joys was to go into our workroom at night; we then perceived on all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes of the bottles of capsules containing our products [â\x80¦] The glowing tubes looked like faint, fairy lights.â\x80\x9d"", 'Itâ\x80\x99s no surprise then that Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia, likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation, in 1934. Even her notebooks are still radioactive a century later. Today, theyâ\x80\x99re stored in lead-lined boxes, and will likely remain radioactive for another 1500 years.', 'Two years after winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, Marie and Pierre Curie took part in investigations of Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium who claimed she could channel the dead, and attended a number of seances. Pierre apparently thought some of the feats Palladino performedâ\x80\x94which included levitating objects and tablesâ\x80\x94were the real deal. (Marie didnâ\x80\x99t seem to be quite as convinced.)', 'Curie had been a double Nobel laureate for only a few years when she considered parting ways with her medals. At the start of World War I, France put out a call for gold to fund the war effort, so Curie offered to have her two medals melted down. When bank officials refused to accept them, she settled for donating her prize money to purchase war bonds.', 'Marieâ\x80\x99s desire to help her adopted country fight the new war didnâ\x80\x99t end with donating her prizes. After making the donation, she developed an interest in X-raysâ\x80\x94not a far jump from her previous work with radiumâ\x80\x94and it didnâ\x80\x99t take her long to realize that the emerging technology could be used to aid soldiers on the battlefield. ', 'Curie convinced the French government to name her director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and persuaded her wealthy friends to fund her idea for a mobile X-ray machine. She learned to drive and operate the vehicle herself and treated wounded soldiers at the Battle of the Marne, ignoring protests from skeptical military doctors. Her invention was proven effective at saving lives, and ultimately 20 â\x80\x9cpetite Curies,â\x80\x9d as the X-ray machines were called, were built for the war.', 'Following World War I, Marie Curie embarked on a different fundraising mission, this time with the goal of supporting her research centers in Paris and Warsaw.

185,One Misconception About Each Planet in the Solar System,"['misconceptions', 'astronomy', 'youtube channel', 'space']","['Poor Pluto. For 76 years, it occupied the coveted spot as the ninth planet in our solar system, the farthest from our sun. A mysterious celestial body whose diameter is about the distance between New York and Houston, with an average temperature of -387Â°F. The lord of five moons. The only planet named by an 11-year-old girl. Pluto had a lot going for it.', 'But in 2006, it was knocked off its planetary pedestal by astronomers at the International Astronomical Union. So no, Pluto doesnâ\x80\x99t count as one of the planets in our solar system. But it wasnâ\x80\x99t as cut-and-dried a decision as you might imagine. Letâ\x80\x99s take a look at that controversy along with one misconception about each of the still-recognized planets, adapted from an episode of Misconceptions on YouTube.', 'According to the International Astronomical Union, a celestial body has to meet three criteria to be considered a fully recognized planet in our solar system. One, it has to orbit the sun, which Pluto definitely does. Two, it has to be roughly sphericalâ\x80\x94check. And three, it has to be the most gravitationally dominant object in its orbit, clearing the area of similarly sized objects (with a few agreed-upon exceptions). Thatâ\x80\x99s where Pluto fails the test. It still shares some turf with other large objects in the Kuiper Belt, which means it hasnâ\x80\x99t cleared its orbital area.Â\xa0', 'The union voted to recategorize Pluto as a dwarf planet. But the move was super controversial. Less than 5 percent of the worldâ\x80\x99s astronomers took part in the vote, and many others disagreed with the International Astronomical Unionâ\x80\x99s criteria. There was a major public outcry. Adults who had grown up learning about the nine familiar planets were confused and upset. What should my very educated mother just serve us now?', 'Many respected scientists remain convinced that Pluto should be a planet due to its size, shape, and orbit, no matter what the eggheads at the IAU think. People have â\x80¦ strong opinions about Pluto.Â\xa0', 'Tiny, rocky Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest in the whole solar system, not counting Pluto. It has an oval-shaped orbit that brings it as near as 29 million miles to the sun and up to 43 million miles away from it. But even at that relative proximity, itâ\x80\x99s still not the hottest planet.', 'Mercury turns on its axis pretty slowly. Each full day/night cycle on Mercury takes 176 Earth days. Its average temperature during a long daytime can reach a toasty 800Â°F. Its nighttime average plunges to -290Â°F, which is far too cold to sustain life, as far as we know.', 'The main reason for the big swing in temps is Mercuryâ\x80\x99s lack of atmosphere. On Earth, the atmosphere protects us from solar radiation and insulates the planet from extreme temperature variations. Mercury has none of these perks. Instead, it has an exosphere of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, and other atoms that have been scoured off Mercuryâ\x80\x99s surface by blasts of solar wind and meteoroid impacts. With no cozy atmospheric blanket to trap heat, Mercury loses the warmth it absorbs during its days.', 'People often think of Earth and Venus as twinsies. Theyâ\x80\x99re roughly the same size and density. Theyâ\x80\x99re both rocky planets featuring valleys, mountains, and volcanoes. Unlike Mercury, both Earth and Venus have atmospheres that trap gasses and heat.', 'But â\x80¦ thatâ\x80\x99s about where the similarities end. Venus differs from Earth in some major ways, like in its toxic cocktail of atmospheric compounds, which retain tons of heat to make Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. Its surface temp can reach a scorching 900Â°F. Instead of Earthâ\x80\x99s breathable blend of oxygen and nitrogen, Venusâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cairâ\x80\x9d is primarily carbon dioxide, the same stuff causing global warming on our own planet. Instead of our clouds of harmless water, Venusâ\x80\x99s clouds are made of deadly sulfuric acid. The planetâ\x80\x99s incredibly dense atmosphere exerts the same amount of pressure as Earthâ\x80\x99s oceans at a depth of half a mile.', 'Plus, Earth supports life, while nothing living has been found on Venus. But that doesnâ\x80\x99t mean scientists arenâ\x80\x99t looking. While the surface of Venus is way too hot to accommodate life as we know it, the planetâ\x80\x99s atmosphere actually thins and cools as altitude increases. Thirty miles above the surface of Venus, temperatures vary between 86Â°F and 158Â°F, and the pressure relents to about the same level found on the Earthâ\x80\x99s surface. That leads some scientists to consider the possibility of extremophile bacteria, like those found in hydrothermal vents or ultra-acidic volcanoes on Earth, living in Venusâ\x80\x99s poisonous clouds. Scientists have even detected some mysterious black streaks at the tops of the clouds, which may be caused by iron-rich depositsâ\x80\x94or perhaps by an as-yet-undiscovered microbial form with a chemical makeup that can withstand Venusâ\x80\x99s toxic atmosphere. But for now, thatâ\x80\x99s only a speculative theory.', 'Just because Earth isnâ\x80\x99t perfectly round does not mean itâ\x80\x99s actually flat. That idea got debunked even earlier than 1492, when Columbus supposedly proved that you couldnâ\x80\x99t sail off the edge of the planet.Â\xa0', 'Scientific evidence does show that Earth is not a perfectly round sphere. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Earth is an â\x80\x9cirregularly shaped ellipsoid.â\x80\x9d Itâ\x80\x99s about 26 miles wider in diameter at the equator than it is at the poles, due to the centrifugal force generated by Earth spinning on its axis. Basically, itâ\x80\x99s fatter around the middle.Â\xa0', 'But thatâ\x80\x99s not the whole story: Earthâ\x80\x99s shape is constantly changing topographically. Floods erode land. Volcanoes create new land. Earthquakes can alter the land in dramatic ways. And climate change is having a huge impact on our planetâ\x80\x99s geophysics. When Earthâ\x80\x99s mass shifts from one place to another, it affects the planetâ\x80\x99s gravitational forces. Hereâ\x80\x99s an example: Greenland is losing mass rapidly because its ice sheet is melting. The remaining ice sheet doesnâ\x80\x99t press down on the bedrock of Greenland as much, because it weighs less, so the ground is actually rising. A 2020 paper reported that at one place in Greenland, the land has risen roughly 10 feet above relative sea level since 1900â\x80\x94in other words, a large, scary amount.', 'At the same time, since Greenland is losing mass, itâ\x80\x99s also losing gravitational force. The ocean volume that used to â\x80\x9chugâ\x80\x9d Greenlandâ\x80\x99s shores is drifting to the tropics instead, increasing that regionâ\x80\x99s gravitational force. You can see it in the rising seas around islands in the south Pacific Ocean, which leads to flooding and other problems for residents.', 'In some ways, Mars is more of a sibling planet to Earth than Venus is. No other planet besides Earth has been scrutinized as much as Mars, from the work of ancient Egyptian astronomers to todayâ\x80\x99s robotic rovers and orbiters.

As it turns out, yes. There are a few reasons why.', 'One, itâ\x80\x99s really far. When Earth and Mars are at the nearest points in their orbits to each other, a phenomenon called â\x80\x9cclose approach,â\x80\x9d Mars is still at least 34 million miles awayâ\x80\x94and thatâ\x80\x99s the absolute theoretical minimum, given fluctuations over time. In 2022, the close approach actually left us over 50 million miles away. Because the planetsâ\x80\x99 orbits are elliptical and the distance between them varies, close approach doesnâ\x80\x99t happen very oftenâ\x80\x94usually about every 26 months. That means the optimal window for successfully launching a spacecraft to Mars is limited to roughly once every two years.', 'Two, we donâ\x80\x99t have the technology to keep an astronaut alive during the journey. Any trip to Mars currently requires a minimum of 21 months due to the positioning of the planets during the journey: Beginning with the launch window near close approach, it would take nine months to fly from Earth to Mars. Then the crew would need to spend three to four months waiting for the planets to align for the nine-month return trip. The crew would need to bring every single thing for sustaining life with them: food, water, clothing, oxygen, and fuel, plus scientific instruments, building materials, spare parts, medical supplies â\x80¦ the list goes on. And while we might be able to drop off some of these supplies on Mars, thereâ\x80\x99s still the whole getting there thing. Todayâ\x80\x99s spacecrafts donâ\x80\x99t have the ability to carry all that weight for so long.', 'Three, nobody knows exactly how to land a crewed spacecraft in Marsâ\x80\x99s thin atmosphere or how astronauts would fare on the Red Planet. Astronaut Scott Kelly experienced several physiological changes after spending one year aboard the International Space Station, and itâ\x80\x99s likely that any Martian voyager would experience worse. Would the long-term exposure to the Martian atmosphere cause medical problems? Would the relative lack of gravity cause muscles to turn to Jell-O? Would oneâ\x80\x99s heart and organs continue to function over such long periods? Maybe? We just donâ\x80\x99t know.', 'For all these reasons and more, humans have never been to Mars, but research into the possibility continues.', 'Jupiter is the larger of what astronomers call the â\x80\x9cgas giants,â\x80\x9d which also include Saturn. Unlike the four rocky planets already mentioned, the gas giantsâ\x80\x99 mass is primarily, well, what we think of as gases, such as hydrogen and helium, along with some liquids. But that doesnâ\x80\x99t mean you can zoom through it.', 'Jupiterâ\x80\x99s mass is more than twice that of all other planets put together. Gravity holds all of the swirling matter in a rapidly rotating ball. Any spacecraft attempting a fly-though would first meet the three layers of Jupiterâ\x80\x99s cloud system, which is about 44 miles thick and contains a mix of frozen ammonia and water ice. The clouds collide with warmer gasses rising from Jupiterâ\x80\x99s interior, creating powerful winds and storms. The Great Red Spot is a monster storm with winds topping 400 miles per hour. Try getting a command module through that.', 'But, letâ\x80\x99s say you make it past the cloud layer and enter Jupiterâ\x80\x99s inner atmosphere. Crushing pressure and skyrocketing temperatures turn gases into liquids and form what NASA calls the solar systemâ\x80\x99s largest ocean. The 25,000-mile-deep pool of liquid metallic hydrogen can conduct electricity. It also uses the planetâ\x80\x99s fast rotation to generate an immensely strong magnetic field. Itâ\x80\x99s no Sea of Tranquility.Â\xa0', 'Finally, you wouldnâ\x80\x99t even get close to Jupiterâ\x80\x99s mysterious core. This roiling mix of iron and silicates, which could be either a stew of loose matter or a solid form, may reach 90,000Â°F.', 'Pretty much everything weâ\x80\x99ve learned about Jupiter weâ\x80\x99ve gleaned by observing it from afar, and the one craft we deliberately crashed into itâ\x80\x94Galileo, in 2003â\x80\x94didnâ\x80\x99t emerge from the other side. As NASA says, the probe â\x80\x9cpenetrated 124 miles into Jupiterâ\x80\x99s violent atmosphere before it was crushed, melted, and/or vaporized by the intense pressure and temperature.â\x80\x9d The bottom line: Your puny spaceship, on its way through Jupiter, isnâ\x80\x99t gonna make it.', 'Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system as well as the smaller gas giant, but its rings instantly set it apart from its planetary neighbors. Galileo observed Saturnâ\x80\x99s bright rings through a telescope in 1610, the same year he discovered Jupiterâ\x80\x99s four largest moons. The Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens formally described the rings in 1655. Over the following four centuries, though, astronomers struggled to understand the ringsâ\x80\x99 composition and origins, mainly because Saturn is so far from Earthâ\x80\x94an average of 900 million miles away.', 'That began to change in 1979, when NASA sent the first spacecraft to Saturn. By that time, scientists had observed Saturnâ\x80\x99s main rings and dubbed them A, B, and C.', 'Fainter rings were dubbed D and E. (No points for creativity there.) The space probe Pioneer 11, Earthâ\x80\x99s first visitor to Saturn, discovered another ring along with other clues to their makeup. Then, Voyager 1 and 2 captured images showing that the main rings are actually thousands of thin ringlets.Â\xa0', 'In 1997, NASA launched the Cassini orbiter on a mission to Saturn. It took about seven years to get there. Once it arrived, it began orbiting the planetâ\x80\x94the first spacecraft to ever do thatâ\x80\x94and beaming back incredibly detailed images of the planetâ\x80\x99s rings.Â\xa0', 'They do resemble a solid grooved plane surrounding the planet, like a close-up of Voyagerâ\x80\x99s Golden Record. But each ring is composed of countless fragments of water ice and rock, the remains of asteroids, comets, or moons that broke up when they came into contact with Saturnâ\x80\x99s gravity. Some of the pieces are as tiny as grains of sand; some are the size of mountains, and the rest fall somewhere in between. And like a vinyl LP, the rings are super flat: the main rings are 170,000 miles in diameter, but only 30 feet to a half-mile in height. They vary in density and shape, and some rings intertwine with their neighbors.', 'But that wasnâ\x80\x99t allâ\x80\x94Cassini also captured never-before-seen details about Saturnâ\x80\x99s largest moons. It deployed the European Space Agencyâ\x80\x99s Huygens probe to the surface of Titan, revealing topography carved into mountains and valleys. It also discovered liquid water on Enceladus, ejected from geyser-like formations possibly fed by relatively warm pools of water below the moonâ\x80\x99s surface. It even discovered another ring around Saturn.', 'So, Saturnâ\x80\x99s rings are anything but solid. And even though Cassini ran low on fuel and was intentionally flown into Saturn itself in 2017 (RIP), astronomers are still making discoveries from its 20-year mission.', 'Letâ\x80\x99s get the jokes out of the way right now. The planet Uranusâ\x80\x94generally pronounced â\x80\x9cYUR-a-nusâ\x80\x9d in scientific circlesâ\x80\x94really got the short end of the stick when astronomer William Herschel discovered it in 1781. Herschel initially wanted to name it Georgium Sidus after the reigning monarch, George III. But that wasnâ\x80\x99t too popular outside of Great Britain, so astronomers agreed on Uranus instead. The name honors the Greek god of the sky.', 'Voyager 2 conducted our only fly-by of Uranus back in 1986. From the data collected by Voyager 2 and a variety of telescopes, weâ\x80\x99ve learned a few key facts. Itâ\x80\x99s one of the least-dense planets in the solar system and one of two ice giants (the other one is Neptune). It has several faint rings and 27 moons. Uranusâ\x80\x99s mass is mostly water and ammonia surrounding a tiny rocky core that can reach 9000Â°F.Â\xa0', 'Uranusâ\x80\x99s atmosphere is a different story: Itâ\x80\x99s a big gassy blanket of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The same gas that cows expel also gives Uranus its aquamarine-blue color. On top of that, the planet supports clouds of hydrogen sulfide, which is responsible for its, uh, signature scent. It seems a little on the nose, but Uranus really does smell like farts.', 'In 2018, a team led by Oxford University researcher Patrick Irwin confirmed the long-debated composition of these odiferous clouds by analyzing the way they refracted sunlight. The data suggested the clouds were made up of molecules of hydrogen sulfide, the same compound that makes rotten eggs stink, which seemed to pervade the planetâ\x80\x99s cold and windy upper atmosphere.', 'Fortunately, the scientists didnâ\x80\x99t have to actually go there and take a sniff for themselves. As Irwin noted, â\x80\x9csuffocation and exposure in the -200Â°C [-328Â°F] atmosphere made of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane would take its toll long before the smell.â\x80\x9d', 'We donâ\x80\x99t know a lot about Uranus, but we know even less about Neptune, the outermost planet. Voyager 2 flew by Neptune on its 1980s mission. We know that the planet has faint rings, several moons, and the windiest atmosphere in the solar system, with gusts blasting up to 1200 miles per hour.', 'Like Uranus, Neptune has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium, and a smidgen of methane, which makes it appear blue. But Neptune is a deeper cobalt blue, contrasting with Uranusâ\x80\x99s light turquoise blue. Scientists have wondered what the differentiating factor could be, since their size, mass, and chemical composition are so similar.', 'Using the same telescopes that helped them uncover Uranusâ\x80\x99s smell, the Oxford researchers discovered that Uranus is enveloped in a much thicker obscuring layer of methane haze, which appears whitish. It might be the result of a long-ago impact that quieted the activity in Uranusâ\x80\x99s lower atmosphere. Neptuneâ\x80\x99s haze layer is thinner and may have precipitated like snow, revealing its deeper blue hue.', 'On the other hand, NASAâ\x80\x99s new James Webb Space Telescope gave us an entirely new view of Neptune last September. Whereas Voyager 2 pictured Neptune as a dark blue dot, Webbâ\x80\x99s infrared telescope showed it as a dazzling white orb circled with glowing rings. Seven of Neptuneâ\x80\x99s 14 known moons appear. Triton, its largest and strangest moon, shines like a bright star thanks to its reflective frozen nitrogen-covered surface. With Webbâ\x80\x99s ability to capture unprecedented detail, we will surely learn more about Neptune in the years to come.', 'This article was updated in 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/solar-system-misconceptions

The phenomenon might look like a biblical plague, but the source is far more mundane.

Not all harmful algal blooms are red; some are blue, green, brown, or even purple. They occur all over the world. In the Gulf of Mexico, the culprit behind red tides washing onto coastlines from Texas to Florida is usually a type of microscopic algae called Karenia brevis. It produces a toxic compound that affects the central nervous system of fish, sea turtles, manatees, and dolphins, often with fatal results. In addition to generating the neurotoxin, K. brevis can become airborne and cause symptoms in humans like coughing, skin irritation, and watery eyes [PDF]. Not all algae blooms produce toxins that harm humans or animals, however.', 'Algae blooms may occur naturally or be helped along by runoff from farms and coastal development that flows into streams and rivers, which make their way into oceans. In particular, runoff from agricultural areasâ\x80\x94which may include fertilizers and livestock poopâ\x80\x94can contain abundant nutrients, such as nitrogen, that turbocharge the algaeâ\x80\x99s growth.

187,The History of Molecular Gastronomy,"['food', 'history', 'food history', 'news', 'video', 'youtube channel']","['The most iconic dish Spanish chef Ferran AdriÃ\xa0 made at his restaurant El Bulli in Catalonia was deceptively simple: a morsel resembling a green olive, served on a spoon. When guests put that sphere in their mouths, it melted into a liquid explosion of concentrated olive flavor.Â\xa0', 'The dish was a trick of chemistry. AdriÃ\xa0 added olive juiceâ\x80\x94which contains calciumâ\x80\x94to alginate. The substance, typically found in seaweeds, can rearrange its structure to form strong chains in the presence of certain chemicals. And when substances containing calcium are submerged in a sodium alginate solution, a water insoluble, gel-like membrane forms, and the substance maintains a round, droplet shape in a process known as reverse spherification. When AdriÃ\xa0 dropped his olive puree into sodium alginate for a few minutes, what came out were perfect, olive-shapedâ\x80\x94and intensely olive-flavoredâ\x80\x94quasi-liquid olives.', 'El Bulli closed in 2011, but the shockwaves this edible science experiment sent through the food world are still, in some ways, being felt today. Was molecular gastronomy a necessary culinary breakthrough or an elitist misstep? What does molecular gastronomy even mean? Break out your agar-agar and polish off your centrifugeâ\x80\x94itâ\x80\x99s time to take a look at controversial beginnings of molecular gastronomy.', 'Molecular gastronomy is synonymous with modernist cuisine today, but its origins date back centuries. According to food historian Gilly Lehmann, medieval and renaissance chefs were scientists of a sort. They often incorporated contemporary medical beliefs into their dishes and were known to use the new science around them to contribute to their culinary pyrotechnics.Â\xa0', 'Thatâ\x80\x99s not a figurative statement: The 15th-century manuscript The Vivendier has a well-nigh unmake-able and almost certainly deadly recipe to â\x80\x9cMake that Chicken Sing when it is dead and roasted.â\x80\x9d It involves stuffing the chicken with sulfur and mercury, heating it, and then further manipulating the bird so that air escapes and somehow mimics the sound of a chicken.Â\xa0', 'In the 17th century, French physicist Denis Papin created what was termed a â\x80\x9cdigester.â\x80\x9d A diner from the Royal Society, who had gone to check out the invention, wrote that it made â\x80\x9cthe hardest bones of beef itself, and mutton ... as soft as cheese.â\x80\x9d Papin had invented the ancestor of the modern pressure cooker.', 'In the 1700s, exciting new discoveries from the field of chemistry were applied to the culinary arts. French chemist Antoine BaumÃ© invented a method to measure the specific gravity of liquids now known as the BaumÃ© scale. Specific gravity is also called relative density, which is a good indication of its meaning: It compares the density of substances to a reference materialâ\x80\x94which, when measuring liquids, is usually water.Â\xa0', 'For years, BaumÃ©â\x80\x99s method was an important tool in many areas of food production, from brewing beer to winemaking. Itâ\x80\x99s since been largely supplanted by the simplified Brix scale, but even today there are vintners who will use a BaumÃ© measurement to estimate the level of dissolved solids in their grape juice. That gives them a good idea of the sugar content in the juice and, by extension, the potential alcohol levels in their finished wine. If we think of winemaking as half art and half science, BaumÃ© helped push the science part of the equation forward.', 'BaumÃ© is also the namesake for the BaumÃ© egg, which can be made by submerging a whole egg in alcohol for about a month. Over time, the ethanol seeps through the pores of the shell and coagulates the egg inside, effectively cooking it with no heat required.Â\xa0', 'Preparing a BaumÃ© egg feels closer to modern molecular gastronomy than simply frying one in a pan, but itâ\x80\x99s a bit hard to articulate why. After all, the change an egg goes through when exposed to heat is a molecular one, too. For that matter, so is curing meat, fermenting vegetables, and almost every other form of food preparation or preservation humans have been practicing for millennia. This makes molecular gastronomy tricky to define.', 'HervÃ© This is a scientist and magazine editor and one of the pioneers in the field; he distinguishes between molecular cookery and molecular gastronomy. In his understanding, molecular cookery involves using new techniques and science to make better food and should be considered an art, rather than a science. Molecular gastronomy, on the other hand, is the scientific discipline of understanding cooking. Even This admits, though, that there isnâ\x80\x99t any one universally accepted definition of the term.', 'When people think of molecular gastronomy today, theyâ\x80\x99re usually thinking of the intersection of food, science, and even theater that was exemplified at restaurants like El Bulli. And that has its own antecedents in culinary history.Â\xa0', 'French chef and cookbook author Marie-Antoine CarÃªme became famous for experimenting with a presentation-forward cooking style in the early 19th century. It didn\'t feature the chemical wizardry thatâ\x80\x99s essential to modern molecular gastronomy today, but it did bring together art and science in the form of edible architecture. Creations heâ\x80\x99s credited with, like the choux pastry puff tower known as croquembouche, were meant to be a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. CarÃªme constructed other centerpiece desserts to resemble ancient structures like temples and pyramids. He summed up his attitude in one of his cookbooks: â\x80\x9cI want order and taste. A well-displayed meal is enhanced one hundred percent in my eyes.""', 'The haute cuisine pioneered by CarÃªme was a hit in the dining rooms of the wealthy, but he didnâ\x80\x99t intend for his style of cooking to be exclusive. In the several cookbooks he authored in his lifetime, he shared instructions for pulling off complicated cooking techniques in a home kitchen. According to Eater, CarÃªmeâ\x80\x99s were the first cookbooks to use the phrase you can try this for yourself at home.', 'CarÃªme may have inadvertently laid the groundwork for one strand of what would become molecular gastronomy, but it would take a long time for the term itself to arise. In 1988, cooking school instructor Elizabeth Cawdry Thomas and physics professor Ugo ValdrÃ¨ met in Italy and agreed on the potential value of a workshop focused on the science of food. At that time, new scientific advancements in the culinary arts were generally the domain of industrial food manufacturers; they werenâ\x80\x99t viewed as tools for home or restaurant chefs. The idea sparked by Cawdry Thomas eventually became the Erice Workshops, which began in Sicily in 1992.', 'This is where the term molecular gastronomy first appeared publicly, according to Dr. Harold McGee, who eventually became one of the workshopâ\x80\x99s co-organizers. The original posters publicizing the event advertised an â\x80\x9cInternational Workshop on Molecular and Physical Gastronomy,â\x80\x9d but the blend of science and cooking discussed at these conferences was different from the theatrical, innovative style of fine dining that rose to prominence in the coming years. â\x80\x9cThe purpose was really to understand traditional cookingâ\x80\x94the science of foods that have been traditionally prepared in restaurants and were considered the height of the art of cooking,â\x80\x9d McGee tells Mental Floss. As for why the word molecular was chosen in the first place, it was all about timing; molecular biology was a trendy field in the early 1990sâ\x80\x94even people outside the scientific community were hearing about it.', 'Cawdry Thomas recruited Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti to be the workshopâ\x80\x99s director. HervÃ© This also signed on. Cawdry Thomasâ\x80\x99s contributions didnâ\x80\x99t stop at the conception stage; once the event was up and running, she led several workshops, including a blind tasting of tomatoes with various kinds of salts and another blind tasting comparing foods prepared in a microwave versus conventional cooking methods.Â\xa0', 'Though she was integral to the endeavor, Cawdry Thomasâ\x80\x99s role has often been overlooked, with media highlighting Thisâ\x80\x99s and Kurtiâ\x80\x99s contributions instead.Â\xa0', ""â\x80\x9cThere was the professional hierarchy,â\x80\x9d McGee says. â\x80\x9cYou know, there are professors of physics and then there are cooking school teachers. And, you know, the hierarchy back then and still now, I'm sure, was pretty clear. And then, also: The world of cooking back then and the world of science back thenâ\x80\x94and stillâ\x80\x94were dominated by men. There were, to my recollection, no women cooks, no women chefs invited to this meeting. Elizabeth was always there to make things happen, to introduce people to each other. Just a wonderfully warm, welcoming presence. I think, actually [she] probably felt more comfortable behind the scenes than on stage. But that doesn't excuse the fact that all along her contribution was really neglected. I don't think the workshop would have taken place without her.â\x80\x9d"", 'The goal of that initial workshop was to bring together chefs, writers, and scientists to discuss four areas of interest: what was already understood about the science of cooking; how a better understanding of science could improve existing cooking methods; the benefits of developing new kinds of cooking techniques and ingredients; and whether approaches used in industrial food processing could be adapted to smaller kitchens.Â\xa0', 'Though these summits are sometimes thought of as the birthplace of modern molecular gastronomy, they werenâ\x80\x99t a forum for chefs to brainstorm whimsical dishes for $300 tasting menus. Rather, the participants were more concerned with the practical applications of science on the broader culinary scene.Â\xa0', 'Around the same time as the Erice workshops, Ferran AdriÃ\xa0 was pioneering the foam and eyedropper style of cooking thatâ\x80\x99s more commonly thought of as molecular gastronomy today.Â\xa0', 'â\x80\x9cWhat we were doing in the Erice meetings was along the same lines, you know, part of the zeitgeist in the culinary world. Classic French cooking that then became standard international hotel cooking was: You just followed a book, the Escoffier playbook,â\x80\x9d McGee says. â\x80\x9cIn the 1960s, in France, along with nouvelle roman, the new novel, the new movies and so on, there was also a movement for the new cooking: nouvelle cuisine. I see what happened in Spain as kind of the explosive outgrowth of something that really began in the sixties in Franceâ\x80\x94and, in particular, with this one guy, Ferran AdriÃ¡, who was just you know, he was the GaudÃ\xad of cooking.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'McGee explains that AdriÃ\xa0 â\x80\x9chad a completely new way of thinking about things, an approach that would, in the end, really benefit from a scientific understanding of food and cookingâ\x80\x94which is, I think, why the science of food and cooking, or one of the reasons that the science of food and cooking became of such general interest. What he had done was taken ingredients and completely transformed them physically. And that just changes the experience of eating because, you know, you look at a leaf of lettuce, you know what itâ\x80\x99s going to taste like, but you look at a green blob, you have no idea until you put it in your mouth.â\x80\x9d', 'Those flavored foamsâ\x80\x94made with whipped cream canistersâ\x80\x94were so sensational that they led to a spate of knockoffs, often perceived to be covering up for sub-par cooking. In a piece by Jeremy Repanich for Robb Report, the chef Alex Stupak likened the use of once-daring techniques by lesser chefs to the â\x80\x9cpyrotechnics at a Kiss concert. Take that away, take your face paint away and you suck.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'After taking over El Bulli as head chef, AdriÃ\xa0 launched his own series of culinary workshops centered around developing new menus. The restaurant was open for six months out of the year, and for the other six months, he led his team of chefs in experimenting with new cooking techniques and translating them into finished dishes. This combination of meticulous, empirical experimentation and total artistic freedom may be at the heart of molecular gastronomy, and it led to El Bulli being named Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant Magazine five times throughout the 2000s.Â\xa0', 'At the same time, a new class of chefs were expounding the bounds of cooking in their own restaurants. At the Fat Duck in Bray, England, British chef Heston Blumenthalâ\x80\x94who actually attended the last two Erice workshopsâ\x80\x94put a mad scientist spin on haute cuisine. One of his influential trademarks was the use of liquid nitrogen in cooking. ', 'With a boiling point of -321Â°F, the substance allows chefs to bring ingredients to freezing cold temperatures in seconds. One reason frozen food gets a bad rap is the propensity for ice crystals to form and disrupt an itemâ\x80\x99s cellular structure. The bigger the crystals are, the more the texture of the food changes. But when food freezes quickly, these crystals are smaller and the structure of the ingredients remain intact. Blumenthal used this principle when developing Nitro-Poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse, a palate cleanser served at the Fat Duck, flash-frozen tableside.Â\xa0', 'American chef Wylie Dufresne is considered another pioneer of molecular gastronomy. At his New York restaurant wd~50, which closed in 2014, one of the signature dishes was a deconstructed eggs benedict. It consisted of sous-vide egg yolks, Canadian bacon wisps, and fried hollandaise. That last component was apparently the trickiest to perfect. Dufresne and his team pulled it off by adding gelatin to the sauce so it could be cut into portions and adding starch to protect the egg yolks in the hollandaise from high heat, thus preventing them from scrambling.Â\xa0', ""Today, Dufresne's passion for tinkering has taken him in a seemingly different direction, running his own doughnut shop and pop-up pizzeria in New York City. But these humble foods are no less the products of food science than noodles made with methylcelluloseâ\x80\x94or, indeed, â\x80\x9cpizza pebbles,â\x80\x9d a deconstructed dish that was once on the menu of wd~50. Dufresne even gave a lecture at Harvard in 2021 about his quest for pizza dough perfection, touching on topics like gluten levels, cold fermentation, and manipulating carbon dioxide. "", 'Perhaps the other American chef most commonly associated with molecular cuisine is Grant Achatz. Itâ\x80\x99s not hard to see the influence of chemistry in the menu of his Chicago restaurant Alinea. The famous translucent pumpkin pie is made by setting concentrated pumpkin pie stock in clear gelatin. And perhaps even more so than some of his peers, Achatz celebrates the artistic side of molecular cooking as well. Like CarÃªme two centuries before him, he prioritizes serving a â\x80\x9cwell-displayed mealâ\x80\x9d that takes heavy inspiration from the art world. A famous dessert course at Alinea is literally painted onto the table to resemble an abstract art piece. A different dessert features edible sugar balloons filled with actual helium guests are encouraged to inhaleâ\x80\x94calling to mind CarÃªmeâ\x80\x99s whimsical pastry towers, but cranked up to 11.Â\xa0', 'In a 2021 article for InsideHook, Achatz explained the emotional part of molecular gastronomy that balances out the cold science, writing, â\x80\x9cI like to say that this style of cooking uses emotions as seasoning: intimidation, confusion, intrigue, happiness, magic, and nostalgia are layered over delicious food by using newly developed techniques, ideas, and equipment to manipulate the food in unexpected ways.â\x80\x9d', 'These chefs are credited with shaping molecular gastronomy, but they havenâ\x80\x99t all embraced the label. Some of them have outright rejected it.Â\xa0', 'When discussing the phrase, Heston Blumenthal told The Guardian, â\x80\x9cMolecular makes it sound complicated â\x80¦ and gastronomy makes it sound elitist.â\x80\x9d Ferran AdriÃ\xa0 has expressed similar sentiments, and instead refers to his style of cooking as â\x80\x9cdeconstructivist.â\x80\x9d Achatz prefers â\x80\x9cprogressive American.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Other names that have been tossed around to describe a science-based approach to fine dining include avant-garde, modernist, and experimental cuisine.Â\xa0', 'None of these terms have succeeded in replacing molecular gastronomy in the cultural lexicon. Sure, the phrase originated with a workshop that had nothing to do with liquid olives or sugar balloons, and maybe the word molecular is both too broad and too specific to describe the cuisine itâ\x80\x99s associated with. But itâ\x80\x99s apt in its own way.

188,19 Brilliant Facts About Albert Einstein,"['einstein', 'history', 'lists', 'math', 'news', 'physics']","['In 1999, Albert Einstein was named TIMEâ\x80\x99s Person of the Century. The father of special and general relativity, Einsteinâ\x80\x99s theories introduced concepts that would help make dozens of modern technologies possible. â\x80\x9cI have no special talents,â\x80\x9d Einstein once said, â\x80\x9cI am only passionately curious.â\x80\x9d Here are some facts about the physicist who gave us wild hair and E=MC^2.', 'On March 14, 1879, baby Einstein emerged with a â\x80\x9cswollen, misshapen head and a grossly overweight body,â\x80\x9d according to Denis Brianâ\x80\x99s book, Einstein: A Life. When she got a look at him later, his grandmother was terrified of the chunky child. She screamed, â\x80\x9cMuch too fat! Much too fat!â\x80\x9d Thankfully, Albert would eventually grow into his body. (However, he did have trouble developing in other arenas: He supposedly didnâ\x80\x99t start speaking until the age of 2.)', 'The young genius had a habit of throwing objects whenever he was displeased; once, a frustrated Einstein even threw a chair at his teacher. The 5-year-old enjoyed bombarding his tutors and family members: His sister Maja, who was often conked in the head by Einsteinâ\x80\x99s fusillades, later quipped, â\x80\x9cIt takes a sound skull to be the sister of an intellectual.â\x80\x9d', 'According to a biography by Alice Calaprice and Trevor Lipscombe, â\x80\x9cWhen he became angry, his whole face turned yellow except for the tip of his nose, which turned white.â\x80\x9d', 'The idea that Einstein had trouble in school is a myth. During summers, a pre-teen Einstein would study mathematics and physics for fun, eventually mastering differential and integral calculus by age 15. But thatâ\x80\x99s not to say he was a perfect student. Einstein hated rote learning and refused to study subjects that didnâ\x80\x99t interest him. So, naturally, when the obstinate number-lover took the entrance exam to the polytechnic school in Zurich, he flunked the language, zoology, and botany sections.', 'Einsteinâ\x80\x99s IQ was never tested, though that hasnâ\x80\x99t stopped people from guessing. Lots of websites claim the physicistâ\x80\x99s IQ was 160, but thereâ\x80\x99s simply no way of verifying that claim. â\x80\x9cOne fundamental problem with the estimates Iâ\x80\x99ve seen is that they tend to conflate intellectual ability with domain-specific achievement,â\x80\x9d Dean Keith Simonton, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis told Biography. For all we know, Einsteinâ\x80\x99s aptitude in arenas outside of physics might have rivaled that of an average Joe.', 'Whenever Einstein needed to relax, he turned to music. He started violin lessons at age 5 and, at around 17, impressed his teachers at cantonal school with his playing during a music exam. Around 1914, when Einstein lived in Berlin, he played sonatas with his friend and fellow theoretical physicist, Max Planck. And after he became famous, Einstein would play a handful of benefit concerts alongside greats like Fritz Kreisler. â\x80\x9cMusic helps him when he is thinking about his theories,â\x80\x9d his second wife, Elsa, said. â\x80\x9cHe goes to his study, comes back, strikes a few chords on the piano, jots something down, returns to his study.â\x80\x9d', 'Einstein hated wearing socks and was immensely proud of the fact that he didnâ\x80\x99t have to wear them while giving lectures at Oxford in the 1930s. His antipathy apparently stemmed from a childhood realization: â\x80\x9cWhen I was young I found out that the big toe always ends up making a hole in a sock,â\x80\x9d Einstein reportedly said. â\x80\x9cSo I stopped wearing socks.â\x80\x9d As an adult, he typically wore an undershirt, baggy trousers held by rope, and a pair of (occasionally womenâ\x80\x99s) sandals.', 'While an undergraduate in Zurich, Einstein fell in love with sailingâ\x80\x94a passion that would persist throughout his life. There was just one problem: He was a horrible sailor. He regularly tipped his boat over and required rescue dozens of times. (His sailboat was named Tinef, Yiddish for â\x80\x9cworthless.â\x80\x9d) In 1935, The New York Times reported on Einsteinâ\x80\x99s sailing misadventures with the punny headline: â\x80\x9cRelative Tide and Sand Bars Trap Einstein.â\x80\x9d', 'As a young man, Einstein sported a well-maintained head of dark hairâ\x80\x94that is, until his son Hans was born in 1904. Like many new parents, Einstein discovered that having a new mouth to feed changed everything: The patent clerk was so busy trying to support his family that he stopped combing his hair and visiting the barber. Slowly, an iconic look was born.', 'Einstein would spurn barbers for the rest of his life. His wife Elsa would cut his mop whenever it became disheveled.', 'When Einstein was a patent clerk, he formed a book club with two friends and called it the â\x80\x9cOlympia Academy.â\x80\x9d The trio usually dined on sausages, GruyÃ¨re cheese, fruit, and tea. But on Einsteinâ\x80\x99s birthday, his friends brought expensive caviar as a surprise. Einstein, who had a knack for mindlessly eating when talking about something he was passionate about, began stuffing his face while discussing Galileoâ\x80\x99s principle of inertiaâ\x80\x94totally unaware of what he was eating. He later offered this excuse: â\x80\x9cWell, if you offer gourmet foods to peasants like me, you know they wonâ\x80\x99t appreciate it.â\x80\x9d', 'Einstein enjoyed the occasional dirty joke. When he accepted his first job as a professor, he said, â\x80\x9c[N]ow I too am an official member of the guild of whores.â\x80\x9d And when a member of his book club gave him a nameplate that said â\x80\x9cAlbert, Knight of the Backside,â\x80\x9d Einstein proudly kept it tacked on his apartment door. Later in life, heâ\x80\x99d tell jokes to his pet parrot, Bibo. (Einstein believed the bird was depressed and needed a laugh.)', 'On his 72nd birthday, Einstein was leaving an event held in his honor. As he was getting into his car, photographers asked him to smile for the camera. Einstein, however, was sick and tired of grinning for a photographâ\x80\x94heâ\x80\x99d been doing it all eveningâ\x80\x94so he popped his tongue out instead. Einstein liked the photo so much, he put it on his greeting cards.', 'Having spent seven years working in the Swiss patent office, Einstein was naturally curious about inventing and secured approximately 50 patents during his lifetime. He enjoyed tinkering with electronics and eventually patented a self-adjusting camera, a refrigerator that could last 100 years, and even a blouse.', 'Einstein, who married twice, had multiple extramarital affairsâ\x80\x94including one dalliance with a possible Russian spy. His first marriage with Mileva MariÄ\x87, a physicist he met at the Swiss Polytechnic School, soured after the birth of their third child. As their marriage crumbled, Einstein imposed a list of brusqueâ\x80\x94if not cruelâ\x80\x94demands which included: â\x80\x9cYou will obey the following points in your relations with me: 1. You will not expect intimacy from me â\x80¦ 2. You will stop talking to me if I request it.â\x80\x9d Unsurprisingly, they divorced. Later, Einstein married his cousin, Elsa LÃ¶wenthal.', 'Einstein was not part of the Manhattan Project, but he was instrumental in getting it started. In the late 1930s, German scientists discovered nuclear fission of uranium, a major step toward the development of the atomic bomb. Much of the worldâ\x80\x99s uranium was held in the Congoâ\x80\x94then a colony of Belgiumâ\x80\x94so two Hungarian-American physicists named Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner decided to get Einstein to write a letter to his friend, the queen of Belgium. Einstein suggested a letter to a Belgian minister instead, but an encounter with an economist who knew President Franklin D. Roosevelt resulted in a change in direction and a letter that prompted America to start its own experiments.', 'Einstein received countless letters from the public, but he always tried to answer mail sent by children. (In one letter, a young girl complained about her troubles with math. The professor supposedly wrote back, â\x80\x9cDo not worry about your difficulty in mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.â\x80\x9d) Einsteinâ\x80\x99s many correspondences with childrenâ\x80\x94filled with charm and encouragementâ\x80\x94are compiled in a book by Alice Calaprice called Dear Professor Einstein.', 'After the first president of the state of Israel, Chaim Weizmann, died in 1952, the prime minister asked Einstein to step into the (mostly ceremonial) role. The physicist declined, writing: â\x80\x9cI am deeply moved by the offer from our state of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions.â\x80\x9d', 'Having abandoned Germany in 1933 to avoid Nazi persecution, Einstein was sensitive to the racial discrimination he saw in the United States. He championed the rights of Black Americans and was a member of the NAACP. When the famed Black singer Marian Anderson came to perform at Princeton in 1937 and was denied a hotel room, Einstein invited her to stay in his home. He was also pen pals with W.E.B. Du Bois and, when Du Bois became the target of the Red Scare, Einstein effectively saved him by offering to be his character witness. In a 1946 speech he delivered at Pennsylvaniaâ\x80\x99s Lincoln University, he called segregation â\x80\x9ca disease of white people,â\x80\x9d vowing, â\x80\x9cI do not intend be quiet about it.â\x80\x9d', 'Yodaâ\x80\x99s face was partly modeled after Einsteinâ\x80\x99s. According to Star Wars special-effects artist Nick Maley, â\x80\x9ca picture of Einstein ended up on the wall behind the Yoda sculptures and the wrinkles around Einsteinâ\x80\x99s eyes somehow got worked into the Yoda design. Over the course of this evolutionary process Yoda slowly changed from a comparatively spritely, tall, skinny, grasshopper kind of character into the old wise spirited gnome that we all know today.â\x80\x9d', 'Itâ\x80\x99s easy to assume that Einsteinâ\x80\x99s theories of relativity are purely theoretical, but they really do affect your everyday life. For instance, the theory of general relativity states that gravity affects time: Time moves by faster for objects in space than objects here on Earth. And that has profound implications for many space-based technologies, especially the accuracy of your GPS. His theories also explain how electromagnets work and are foundational to nuclear technology.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/573985/albert-einstein-facts

From singers to scientists and athletes to activists, here are 130 women who have changed the world.', 'In the early 9th century, in what is now Morocco, Fatima al-Fihri could have lived the rest of her life as a wealthy heiress when she inherited a fortune after her father died. Instead, she established the worldâ\x80\x99s first university. With her inheritance, al-Fihri built a mosque and education center for her community. Those institutions eventually grew into the University of al-Qarawiyyin, established in 859 CE in the city of Fez. The university reportedly attracted students from all over the world, and is still operating today. More than a thousand years later, al-Fihriâ\x80\x99s legacy lives on through academic awards and scholarships in her name. â\x80\x94Olivia Truffaut-Wong', 'Maya Angelou was a writer, poet, civil rights activist, dancer, and director best known for titles such as her autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1928, Angelou fought back against a society filled with racism and prejudice to write more than 30 books, direct 1998â\x80\x99s Down in the Delta starring Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes, recite one of her poems at Bill Clintonâ\x80\x99s inauguration, and be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2010. â\x80\x94Kristen Richard', 'Unlike men, female artists in Renaissance Italy werenâ\x80\x99t allowed to learn their craft by becoming mastersâ\x80\x99 apprentices. But that didnâ\x80\x99t stop Sofonisba Anguissola from studying with other artists like Bernardino Campi, Bernardino Gatti (Il Sojaro), and even Michelangelo himself. Anguissola became one of the few globally recognized female Renaissance artists, thanks to her skill in the art of portraiture. She produced commissioned art for wealthy families, including work for King Philip II, and was always pushing the boundaries of portraiture and rejecting patriarchal conventions of art through her paintings. â\x80\x94Carla Delgado', 'The year 2019 year marked the 100th anniversary of (many) women gaining the right to vote in the United Statesâ\x80\x94and 2020 marked the 200th birthday of one of the women who made it possible: Susan B. Anthony. Born in Massachusetts in 1820, Anthony was a lifelong activist on behalf of womenâ\x80\x99s rights. With fellow suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony founded the American Equal Rights Association in 1866 and traveled the country advocating for voting rights. She and Stanton also edited the organizationâ\x80\x99s newspaper to further disseminate feminist ideas. Though their opposition to the 15th Amendmentâ\x80\x94which gave suffrage to men of all races (in theory), but not womenâ\x80\x94caused a split in the womenâ\x80\x99s movement, Anthony continued to muster support and lobby Congress for suffrage. In one of her most defiant acts, she was arrested simply for casting a ballot in the 1872 presidential election and given a fine of $100â\x80\x94which she refused to pay. â\x80\x94Kat Long', 'Virginia Apgarâ\x80\x99s career was full of firsts: In 1937, she became the first female board-certified anesthesiologist and the first woman to achieve the rank of professor at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she was the first professor of anesthesiology. In 1952, she presented a five-step system for assessing the condition of newborn babies within a minute of birth and periodically after that. Prior to the development of the testâ\x80\x94in which nurses or other delivery room staff assess a babyâ\x80\x99s skin color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone, and breathingâ\x80\x94babies werenâ\x80\x99t typically given much attention after birth, which could lead to problems being missed until it was too late.', 'The test eventually became a backronym for appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration.

Her books, including Pride and Prejudice, were groundbreaking in their use of literary realism and free indirect narrative styleâ\x80\x94modes that would become so commonplace in fiction that itâ\x80\x99s easy to miss how experimental Austenâ\x80\x99s books were in their time. Even two centuries after her death, her stories have retained their appeal to both critics and everyday readers alike, both through her books and the numerous, numerous spin-offs, reimaginings, and adaptations that have been created for film, television, and the stage. â\x80\x94Shaunacy Ferro', 'Thereâ\x80\x99s not a lot to say about Ruth Bader Ginsburg that hasnâ\x80\x99t already been stated: The associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who passed away on September 18, 2020, has been the subject of countless articles and books (including several childrenâ\x80\x99s books), as well as an Oscar-nominated documentary (RBG) and a Felicity Jones-starring biopic (On the Basis of the Sex) that were both released in 2018. That same year, a photo of Ginsburg made a fleeting appearance in Deadpool 2, with the foul-mouthed superhero considering the then-85-year-old for a part in his own superhero team, the X-Force. Many individuals (of the non-superhero kind) could understand why, as Ginsburg spent the better part of her career breaking down barriers and fighting for womenâ\x80\x99s rights and gender parity. All of which is to say that Ginsburgâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9cNotorious RBGâ\x80\x9d moniker was well-earned, and 100 percent accurate. â\x80\x94Jennifer M. Wood', 'On the surface, Josephine Baker is best known as an enchanting singer who wowed crowds pretty much anywhere she performedâ\x80\x94but she was much more than that. A dedicated civil rights and social activist, Baker actually worked as a spy for the French Resistance across North Africa and Europe during WWII. She was known to sneak photos of German military installations across borders by pinning them to her underwear while going through customs and moved top-secret messages across Europe by writing them in invisible ink on her sheet music. The more you learn about Baker, the more unbelievable it all sounds. But make no mistake about it, this multifaceted entertainer was the real deal. â\x80\x94Jay Serafino', 'The French crewmembers of the Ã\x89toile voyage in the 1760s fully intended to circumnavigate the globeâ\x80\x94they just didnâ\x80\x99t think a woman would be doing it with them. Dr. Philibert CommerÃ§on had been hired as the shipâ\x80\x99s botanist on the expedition, and he hatched a plan to bring along his lover, fellow botanist Jeanne Baret.

The ruse worked for a while, but the crew eventually discovered Baretâ\x80\x99s true identity and kicked the couple off the ship as soon as they got to the French colony of Mauritius. Years later, after CommerÃ§on died, Baret married and returned to Franceâ\x80\x94completing the circumnavigation. â\x80\x94Ellen Gutoskey', 'Clarissa â\x80\x9cClaraâ\x80\x9d Harlowe Barton started tending to wounded soldiers just a week after the Civil War began, using supplies from her own home. She proved herself to be a relentless, reliable, fearless nurse throughout the war, eventually earning the nickname â\x80\x9cAngel of the Battlefieldâ\x80\x9d and even narrowly avoiding death herself when a bullet tore through her dress at the Battle of Antietam. Several years after the war had ended, Barton traveled to Switzerland, where she first heard about the International Red Cross and left with an idea to establish a similar organization in the United States. Barton launched the American Red Cross with the help of philanthropist Adolphus Solomons in May 1881, and she served as its president for the next 23 years. â\x80\x94EG', 'British writer and archaelogist Gertrude Bell traveled the world throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but sheâ\x80\x99s best known for her work in the Middle East. She helped preserve ancient treasures from Persian and Arabic history, excavating artifacts in Turkey and Mesopotamia and translating the Persian poet Hafiz. She also advocated for the people living in the region at the time and the preservation of their culture. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Bell championed a self-governed Iraq while also helping Britain draw its modern borders, leaving her with a complicated legacy.Â\xa0â\x80\x94Michele Debczak', 'If you canâ\x80\x99t face the morning without a cup of coffee, you should raise your mug to Melitta Bentz, a German housewife who patented the paper coffee filter in Berlin in 1908. Bentz had grown frustrated with loose grounds winding up in her joe and decided to use a piece of blotting paper from her sonâ\x80\x99s school notebook to filter them.

Since then, Biles has become the most decorated female gymnast in history, setting so many records along the way that it would probably be excessive to list them here. Her powerhouse performances have raised the standard for womenâ\x80\x99s gymnastics around the world, and her unfalteringly sunny attitude and laser focus have taught us all something about how to be better, more successful people. Biles, along with fellow U.S. gymnasts like Aly Raisman, has advocated for victims of sexual assault not only by speaking about her own experiences, but also by criticizing the institutions that allowed such systemic abuses to continue. Bilesâ\x80\x99s demand that USA Gymnastics conduct an independent investigation into team physician Larry Nassarâ\x80\x99s crimes is a moving example of speaking truth to power. â\x80\x94EG', 'The look of Disneyâ\x80\x99s animated films and theme parks in the â\x80\x9940s, â\x80\x9950s, and â\x80\x9960s evolved in many ways thanks to artist and designer Mary Blair.

These Gothic dramas set the stage for their later novels, particularly Jane Eyre, Shirley, and Villette by Charlotte; Wuthering Heights by Emily; and Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne. Each story confronted the shortcomings of Victorian society, particularly the lack of economic opportunities for women, in wildly Romantic narratives set amid the melancholy moors of Yorkshire. To increase their chances of publication, they authored their work under their gender-neutral pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. It was a smart move for the timeâ\x80\x94most of their books were bestsellers, because critics and readers assumed they were written by men. But after Emily and Anne died in 1848 and 1849, respectively, Charlotte pushed back against critics who had dismissed her sistersâ\x80\x99 talents and revealed, in a heartbreaking memorial, all of their true identities. â\x80\x94KL', 'Rachel Carsonâ\x80\x99s 1962 book, Silent Spring, kicked off the modern environmental movement and has been called â\x80\x9cone of the most influential books in the history of modern publishingâ\x80\x9d by The New York Times. By the time the book was published, Carson was a veteran nature writer, capable of explaining science so that everyone could understand it. In Silent Spring, she set her sights on showing the horrific effects pesticides like DDT were having on wildlife and humans alike. She backed up her claims with page after page of evidence. For The Guardian, Margaret Atwood wrote that Carson â\x80\x9cpolished all her rhetorical weapons, and synthesized a wide range of research. She was able to combine a simple and dramatic presentation with a formidable array of backup statistics, and to forge a call to specific action. The impact was enormousâ\x80\x94many groups, pieces of legislation, and government agencies were inspired by it.â\x80\x9d The pesticide industry smeared Carson, but she fought back defiantly until her death from breast cancer in 1964.

As a Black athlete, she was unable to train at segregated facilities, so Coachman devised impromptu routines on her own before landing an athletic scholarship to the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. She won gold in the high jump at the 1948 London Games by launching herself 5 feet and 6 and 1/8 inches in the air, becoming the first Black woman to earn a gold medal in track and field. She made even more history in 1952 when she scored an endorsement deal with Coca-Colaâ\x80\x94the first Black female athlete to do so.

Originally, she became an advocate for affordable housing in the Bay Area when the Plaza Hotel, where she was a tenant, was earmarked for demolition. When she transitioned a few years later, her activism became even more personal. As Gabriel Haaland, a close friend of Collins and a fellow transgender activist, told the SFGate that Collinsâ\x80\x99s ""activism blossomed as she transitioned from male to female."" Collins worked with a number of local groups, including Senior and Disability Action. Collins served as vice chair of San Franciscoâ\x80\x99s LGBT Aging Policy Taskforce and was on the board of directors of the San Francisco Trans March at the time of her death at age 54 in 2013.

It was through the CSO that Huerta met ChÃ¡vez, another activist interested in organizing farmworkers, and in 1962, they founded the National Farm Workers Association (which later became the United Farm Workers of America) together. While ChÃ¡vezâ\x80\x99s charisma helped spread the message, Huerta's formidable lobbying and negotiating skillsâ\x80\x94including the nationwide grape boycotts she helped organizeâ\x80\x94were key in securing some of the first rights for farmworkers in California, including disability insurance for injured workers and the right to organize unions and bargain for better wages.

She was a math teacher, receptionist, bookkeeper, Army secretary, and more before she began taking graduate-level math and physics courses after work. Jackson worked her way up and eventually became the first Black female engineer to work for NASA in 1958. In a profession that is disproportionately dominated by men, she made a considerable impact in NASAâ\x80\x99s hiring and promotion of more woman mathematicians, engineers, and scientists. â\x80\x94CD', 'Lower Manhattan would look radically different today if not for the efforts of Jane Jacobs, an urban activist who took on New York Cityâ\x80\x99s powerful â\x80\x9cmaster builderâ\x80\x9d Robert Moses in the mid-20th century. Her ideas about urban design, enumerated in her seminal book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, were in stark opposition to the car-centric â\x80\x9curban renewalâ\x80\x9d policies that were remaking cities in the 1950s and 1960s. Jacobs advocated for dense, walkable neighborhoods where a bustling â\x80\x9csidewalk balletâ\x80\x9d of people of all ages, races, and incomes going about their daily business at all hours would provide a natural sense of order and safety, thanks to the numerous â\x80\x9ceyes on the streetâ\x80\x9d deterring crime. Jacobsâ\x80\x99s theories and grassroots activism were instrumental in turning public opinion against Mosesâ\x80\x99s plans to build highways through Lower Manhattan in the 1950s and 1960s, including both his plan to install a four-lane road through the West Villageâ\x80\x99s famous Washington Square Park and his larger idea for the Lower Manhattan Expressway, a proposed 10-lane highway that would have obliterated parts of Little Italy and other neighborhoods. In the process, Jacobs changed the way urban designers and planners thought about cities forever. â\x80\x94SF', 'With Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., Minnesota miner Lois Jenson became the first person to ever file a class-action sexual harassment lawsuit in U.S. federal court. Jenson and several other women filed the 1988 suit after spending years working in hostile conditions at the EVTAC mine in Eveleth, Minnesota, where women were regularly groped, harassed, threatened, verbally abused, and more by their male coworkers. She spent the subsequent decade in court fighting the company that managed the mine, before settling in 1998. The lawsuit was the first to treat sexual harassment as a systemic problem, rather than an individual issue, and established that corporations are responsible for maintaining non-hostile work environments. Jensonâ\x80\x99s hard-fought lawsuitâ\x80\x94which served as the influence for the 2005 film North Countryâ\x80\x94helped lay the groundwork for todayâ\x80\x99s #MeToo movement. â\x80\x94SF', 'While Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were preparing to be the first men to land on the moon, a team of â\x80\x9chuman computersâ\x80\x9d were working tirelessly to get them there.

Johnsonâ\x80\x99s calculations were vital to pulling off the Apollo 11 mission, but because she was a Black woman, her work went unrecognized for decades. The 101-year-old, who passed away on February 24, 2020, has since been lauded with awards and in the Oscar-nominated film Hidden Figures (2016). â\x80\x94MD', 'Frida Kahloâ\x80\x99s signature self-portraits adorn everything from museum walls to phone cases. Though she didnâ\x80\x99t exclusively paint herself, the 20th-century Mexican painter repeatedly used her own likenessâ\x80\x94unibrow and mustache proudly includedâ\x80\x94to explore themes of disability, motherhood and miscarriage, sexuality, politics, and more. In both her lifetime and now, she was instantly recognizable by her embrace of traditional Tehuana dress from her motherâ\x80\x99s native Oaxacaâ\x80\x94huipil blouses and colorful skirts that, in addition to being an eye-catching affirmation of her national identity, also served to hide casts and back braces she wore to deal with the devastating effects of a streetcar accident and childhood polio on her spine and lower body. Along with her husband, fellow artist Diego Rivera, Kahlo was also a dedicated Communist who helped bring Leon Trotsky to Mexico a few years after the Russian revolutionary was exiled from the Soviet Union. (Kahlo and Trotksy would go on to have a brief affair, and she would dedicate one of her famous self-portraits to him.) Though she was a well-known figure in artistic circles by her death in 1954, the provocative, eccentric artist has since become an international artistic and feminist icon. â\x80\x94SF', 'Computers are cold, calculating machines by their very nature, so when they began appearing in homes worldwide in the â\x80\x9880s and â\x80\x9890s, they needed to have a consumer-friendly face that made users comfortable at the keyboard. And thatâ\x80\x99s exactly what graphic artist Susan Kare provided when she began her work at Apple in the early 1980s. She was responsible for fonts like Cairo and Chicago, the command key symbol (â\x8c\x98), and plenty of everyday desktop icons, like the floppy disk picture that indicates â\x80\x9cSave.â\x80\x9d These may seem simple on the surface, but they helped establish a universal visual language for the new computer age that allowed both serious tech-heads and newcomers alike to communicate with each other and their desktop machines with ease. â\x80\x94JS', 'Ragnhild KÃ¥ta was born in Norway in 1873. Before she was 5 years old, she lost her vision and hearing from scarlet fever. Years later, she was able to attend a school for the Deaf, where she learned how to speak, read, write, and read lips by touch. KÃ¥ta is commonly known as one of the first Deaf and blind people to learn how to read and write. Methods used in her education later influenced the methods Anne Sullivan famously employed a decade later to teach Helen Keller. In fact, Keller and KÃ¥ta reportedly met in 1890, when Keller was just 10 years old. KÃ¥ta died in 1947. â\x80\x94OTW', 'After an unknown illness caused Helen Keller to lose both sight and hearing at just 19 months old, things looked bleak for the young girl. Resources and opportunities for disabled individuals were scarce in the late 19th century, and Kellerâ\x80\x99s parents struggled to help their daughter, who seemed to be growing increasingly frustrated. However, with the guidance of teacher Anne Sullivan, Keller learned to read Braille and communicate through signing, and graduated from Radcliffe College (the all-female counterpart to the then-all-male Harvard) in 1904. She helped found the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920 and continued to be an indefatigable human rights advocate until her death in 1968â\x80\x94making her a role model for many to this day. â\x80\x94EG', 'Sack lunches would look radically different if it werenâ\x80\x99t for Margaret E. Knight, the 19th-century inventor who gave us the paper bag. The self-taught engineer came up with numerous technological advances during her lifetime, inventing a game-changing safety mechanism for the accident-prone looms of cotton mills when she was just 12 and eventually patenting more than 20 ideas throughout her career. Her most influential work came about as a result of a job Knight took folding bags at the Columbia Paper Bag company in Massachusetts. In an effort to improve the laborious process, Knight built a machine that could cut and fold paper into bags automatically, transforming flat-bottomed paper bags into a cheap, efficient product for daily use. (Previously, grocers packed customersâ\x80\x99 produce into paper cones.) She patented the machineâ\x80\x94a version of which is now housed in the Smithsonianâ\x80\x94in 1871, changing lunches and grocery runs forever. â\x80\x94SF', 'Activism can spark in a variety of ways. For Yuri Kochiyama, all it took was a white sheet. The bedding had been placed around the bed of her father, who was in a California hospital during the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Labeled an enemy because he was Japanese, Kochiyama was arrested and detained, and â\x80\x9cprisoner of warâ\x80\x9d had been written on the fabric. It was a harbinger of the Japanese internment camps that forced Japanese-Americans to spend the war isolated from their communities; Kochiyama and her family were detained for two years. That injustice, coupled with her experience in New Yorkâ\x80\x99s housing projects, compelled Kochiyama to devote her life to the civil rights movement. She founded Asian Americans for Action, supported equality for all minority groups, and became close with Malcolm X. (She was present when he was fatally shot in 1965.) In the 1980s, Kochiyama finally got recognition from the U.S. government of its wartime abuse of power by successfully lobbying for the Civil Liberties Act, which offered an apology for the internment camps as well as reparations. By the time of her death in 2014 at age 93, Kochiyama had spent decades advocating for fair and equitable treatment for all. â\x80\x94JR', 'Katia Krafft and her husband Maurice spent more than two decades traveling the globe, visiting hundreds of the worldâ\x80\x99s volcanoes and inching as close to the action as possible.

In 1965, Stephanie Kwolek was working as a chemist for DuPont when she struck upon a formula for synthetic fiber made of polyamides that looked peculiar in liquid crystalline form but could be spun into an ultra-strong material. The discovery led to Kevlar, which is five times stronger than steel and able to stop a bullet. The armor has saved the lives of countless law enforcement and military officials. â\x80\x94JR', 'When she was 8 years old, Susan LaFlesche Picotte sat at the bedside of a dying old woman. She soon realized that a doctor never cameâ\x80\x94despite having been summoned four timesâ\x80\x94because the woman was a Native American. The incident made Picotte, a member of the Omaha tribe, determined to help heal her community. In 1889, she graduated valedictorian from Womanâ\x80\x99s Medical College of Pennsylvania, becoming the first Native American to earn a medical degree. Picotte then returned home, where she spent the rest of her life tending to the ill and working to improve healthcare on the reservation. â\x80\x94KW', 'In 1951, 31-year-old mother of five Henrietta Lacks visited the Johns Hopkins Hospital to get some irregular bleeding checked out. Doctors found a malignant tumor on her cervix and, without the knowledge of Lacks or her family (as there were no established practices for consent at that time), took a sample of her cancer cells and sent them to the tissue lab of cancer and virus researcher Dr. George Gey. Gey took samples from every cervical cancer patient visiting Johns Hopkins, but Lacksâ\x80\x99s cells were different from all the rest: Those other cells died.

Warne later trained other female detectives, proving that law enforcement needed more than just a few good men. â\x80\x94JR', 'Becoming a journalist as a Black woman during the Reconstruction era was a feat in itself. In addition to breaking into a white- and male-dominated field, Ida B. Wells made history by reporting on the mob lynchings that terrorized Black communities following the Civil War. She was among the first writers to cast the barbaric practice as a tool for white oppression rather than vigilante justice. Even when her work provoked death threats, she continued fighting for racial and gender equality, and today sheâ\x80\x99s remembered as one of the most influential journalists in American history. â\x80\x94MD', 'Karen Wetterhahn was Dartmouth Collegeâ\x80\x99s first female chemistry professor, and also co-founded the schoolâ\x80\x99s Women in Science Project.

Though she immediately followed proper safety protocols, the lab mishap left her doomed. After enduring months of deteriorating health, Wetterhahn died of dimethylmercury poisoning. Before her death in 1997, no one really understood the dangers of the substance, now known to be among the strongest known neurotoxins. Her fate led to increased safety regulations for those who handle the lethal liquid. â\x80\x94KW', 'British philosopher and writer Mary Wollstonecraftâ\x80\x99s belief that women deserved social and economic equality was as unconventional as her biography. Born in 1759 near London, Wollstonecraftâ\x80\x99s experiences as a governess informed her groundbreaking work of feminist thought, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Published in 1792, it offered a counterpoint to French male philosophersâ\x80\x99 arguments that women were incapable of rational thought and independence; Wollstonecraft proposed that if women were educated as men were, they would be more than able to take care of themselves. Wollstonecraft walked the walk, too. In her brief life, she published several more works and had affairs before marrying the radical philosopher William Godwin. She also had two daughters, though only one with Godwin: Mary Shelley, who went on to write Frankenstein. Though Wollstonecraft died shortly after her daughter Maryâ\x80\x99s birth, her work had a strong influence on womenâ\x80\x99s rights leaders like Susan B.

Together, they served as Cornelius Vanderbiltâ\x80\x99s personal clairvoyants, became the first women to found and run a Wall Street brokerage firm, and established a leftist newspaper, Woodhull and Claflinâ\x80\x99s Weekly, which was the first to publish an American English translation of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engelsâ\x80\x99s Communist Manifesto.

Since the days of William Hornaday and Carl Akeley, taxidermy has been a scientific art: It requires practitioners not only to take accurate measurements and photos and make traces of the animals theyâ\x80\x99d like to mount, but to study the anatomy of those animalsâ\x80\x94all for the purpose of creating a specimen that is true to life. Read on for 12 things you might not know about the history, development, and practice of taxidermy.', 'They mean â\x80\x9carrangementâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cskin,â\x80\x9d respectively. Some say the first person to use the word taxidermyÂ\xa0was Louis Dufresne of the MusÃ©um National dâ\x80\x99Histoire Naturelle in Paris, who wrote about it in the 1803 reference book Nouveau Dictionnaire dâ\x80\x99Histoire Naturelle, but according to Merriam-Webster, the word appeared at least three years earlier in an ornithology book written by a zoologist named FranÃ§ois Marie Daudin.', 'Humans have been preserving animals for thousands of yearsâ\x80\x94just look at ancient Egyptâ\x80\x99s mummified cats. But as conservator Amandine PeÌ\x81quignot writes in The History of Taxidermy: Clues for Preservation [PDF], they â\x80\x9cshould not be regarded as true taxidermy,â\x80\x9d because taxidermy and mummification had different goals and techniquesâ\x80\x94for instance, â\x80\x9cMummies were created in a religious context, unlike taxidermy, which developed from a curiosity about nature.â\x80\x9d', 'According to PeÌ\x81quignot, taxidermy began to emerge in the 16th century, when Europeans started to mount the skins of various animals and developed methods and chemicals to preserve them. As the years went on, better methods emerged, and by the 19th century, taxidermy was well established in scientific circles.', 'In 1851, London hosted the Great Exhibition, whichÂ\xa0featured around 100,000 objects from over 15,000 contributorsâ\x80\x94including a lot of taxidermy. The Indian displays included a taxidermied elephant (though that animal was actually an African elephant found in a nearby museum). Also present was J.A. Hancockâ\x80\x99s taxidermy, which the Official Catalogue noted â\x80\x9cwill go far towards raising the art of taxidermy to a level with other arts which have hitherto held higher pretensions.â\x80\x9d And it didâ\x80\x94in the years following the Great Exhibition, taxidermy became a very popular pastime; even a young Theodore Roosevelt took lessons. It got to the point that Victorians would anthropomorphize their taxidermy, dressing stuffed animals in clothes and working them into tableaus like the ones created by Walter Potter. They would also sometimes produce creatures with extra heads or legs.', ""Captain James Cook embarked on a number of exploratory expeditions around the South Pacific, where taxidermy was used to preserve animal specimens. For example, according to Royal Museums Greenwich, itâ\x80\x99s said that the captain brought the first kangaroo skinâ\x80\x94which was supposedly killed by a dog belonging to naturalist Sir Joseph Banksâ\x80\x94to London in 1771. Bird specimens obtained on Cook's expeditions can be seen at institutions like the UKâ\x80\x99s Natural History Museum."", 'John Edmonstone had learned the skill from naturalist Charles Waterton, who brought him on expeditions. Edmonstone charged Darwin a guinea an hour to learn his services; Darwin wrote to his sister that Edmonstone â\x80\x9cgained his livelihood by stuffing birds, which he did excellently.â\x80\x9d Without the skills taught to him by Edmonstone, Darwin likely wouldnâ\x80\x99t have been able to nab a job on the HMS Beagle.', 'This meant that the models were often disfigured. In fact, mounts from those days skewed how we imagined creatures like the long-extinct dodo for years. (The only soft tissue specimen of a dodo, which resides in the collections at UKâ\x80\x99s Oxford University Museum of Natural History, continues to teach us new things about the bird.) Today, taxidermists can purchase a mannequinâ\x80\x94which they can sculpt to achieve the position they want, then stretch and sew the skin over itâ\x80\x94or create their own using old methods, like the Victorian-era process of winding the body shape out of string.', ""When Captain John Hunter sent the first pelt and sketch of a platypus back to England in 1798, many assumed it was a hoaxâ\x80\x94that someone had sewn a duckâ\x80\x99s bill to the coat of a beaver. George Shaw, author of The Naturalist's Miscellany: Or, Coloured Figures Of Natural Objects; Drawn and Described Immediately From Nature, reportedly took scissors to the skin to check for stitches."", 'First place was awarded to taxidermist William Temple Hornadayâ\x80\x99s A Fight in the Tree-Tops, which depicted two male Bornean orangutans fighting over a female. According to Melissa Milgrom in her book Still Life: Adventures in Taxidermy, the scene, which was scientifically accurate, changed the purpose of taxidermyâ\x80\x94it inspired other taxidermists to aim for accuracy in their mounts, too.', ""Carl Akeley (for whom the Akeley Hall of African Mammals at New York's American Museum of Natural History is named) created the first habitat diorama in Americaâ\x80\x94which portrayed muskratsâ\x80\x94in 1889 for the Milwaukee Public Museum."", ""Akeley's obsessive method of preserving one elephant was detailed by his wife in her memoir, The Wilderness Lives Again. Milgrom sums it up in Still Life:"", ""â\x80\x9cAfter the elephant was shot in the bush, he shaded it under a tarp to slow it from decomposing. After he photographed it for reference, he took detailed measurements with a tape measure and calipers, compensating for variations that make a dead animal different from a living one, such as deflated lungs, a limp trunk, and flaccid muscles. Next he cased the skull and leg bones in plaster and made a death mask of the face to capture its fine musculature. ... Akeley skinned animals like a Park Avenue plastic surgeon. All his incisions minimized future seams, so they'd disappear when the animal was assembled later. The legs were cut on the inside; the back was cut longitudinally along the spine; the head was cast, cut off. Once skinned, the elephant was fleshed ... It took Akeley and his team of porters four to five days to remove and prepare the thick, 2000-pound hide, using small knives so they would not mar the skin.â\x80\x9d"", ""Back at the museum, Akeley tanned the hide in a 12-week-long process that turned the 2.5-inch thick skin into quarter-inch leather. He then made an outline of the elephant on the floor and built its internal frameâ\x80\x94using steel, wood, and the elephant's bonesâ\x80\x94on top of it. He covered the frame with wire mesh, and then clay which he sculpted to recreate the elephant's muscles. After placing the skin on this form and making sure the clay accurately replicated â\x80\x9cevery fold and wrinkle,â\x80\x9d Milgrom says, he cast the form in plaster to make a lightweight mannequin, which is what he eventually stretched the skin over. This is the process he used to create the elephants in the Akeley African Hall of Mammals."", 'In addition to his obsessive eye for detailâ\x80\x94he even invented the first portable movie camera to capture footage of animals in the wild, to better create more accurate taxidermy mountsâ\x80\x94Akeley was also a badass: In one of many adventures, he killed a leopard with his bare hands.', 'In those days, competition was fierce, so methods of preservation differed from taxidermist to taxidermist and were closely guardedâ\x80\x94some even went to the grave without revealing their secrets. Fun fact: As a teen, future president Theodore Rooseveltâ\x80\x94who was an avid hunter and nature loverâ\x80\x94tried to purchase a pound of arsenic for taxidermy purposes at a store in Liverpool and was refused. â\x80\x9cI was informed that I must bring a witness to prove that I was not going to commit murder, suicide or any such [dreadful] thing, before I could have it!â\x80\x99 he wrote in his diary. (An adult apparently did vouch for him.)', 'In taxidermy, a specimen is an exact replica of the animal as it appeared in the wild; an example of a trophy is a deer head mounted on the wall.', 'According to Milgrom, in these categories, taxidermists attempt to create an animal without using any of its actual partsâ\x80\x94making an eagle using turkey feathers, for example, or creating a realistic panda using bearskinâ\x80\x94or even recreating extinct species based on scientific data.', 'When the rhino that belonged to Louis XIV and Louis XV was stabbed to death by a revolutionary in 1793, its skin was varnished and stretched over a frame of wooden hoops.

As actor Bill Oddie exerted himself in a bit involving a spoof of kung-fu films, Mitchell began laughing. Loudly. He kept laughing and laughing, with his wife Nessie later estimating that he went on like this for 25 minutes or so. Then, with one climactic belly laugh, he slumped into his chair and died. Mitchellâ\x80\x99s curious demise made headlines worldwide.', 'â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s incredible,â\x80\x9d Nessie said. â\x80\x9cThe doctor told me the left side of his heart failed â\x80¦ the laughter was just too much for him.

A prolonged laughing fit caused a fatal arrhythmia.', ""Laughing can also prompt other bodily dysfunction, at least in theory. Vocal cords could seize up, blocking the flow of oxygen; laughing could also cause one to aspirate food into the trachea; certain connective tissue disorders, like Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, could prompt adverse reactions to spikes in blood pressure, but that's not limited to laughing.

At 5:24 p.m. Eastern time, the sun will be perfectly in line with the equator, resulting in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres receiving equal amounts of sunlight throughout the day. After the vernal equinox has passed, days will start to become shorter for the Southern Hemisphere and longer up north.', 'You may have heard the myth that you can balance an egg on its end during the vernal equinox [PDF], and you may have even tried the experiment in school. The idea is that the extra gravitational pull from the sun when itâ\x80\x99s over the equator helps the egg stand up straight. While it is possible to balance an egg, the trick has nothing to do with the equinox: You can make an egg stand on its end by setting it on a rough surface any day of the year.', 'The equal night and day split between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres isnâ\x80\x99t distributed evenly across all parts of the world. Though every region gets approximately 12 hours of sunlight the day of the vernal equinox, some places get a little more (the day is about 12 hours and 15 minutes in Fairbanks, Alaska), and some get less.', 'The word equinox literally translates to equal (â\x80\x9cequi-â\x80\x9d) and night (â\x80\x9cnoxâ\x80\x9d) in Latin.

My new book, Flight Paths: How a Passionate and Quirky Group of Pioneering Scientists Solved the Mystery of Bird Migration, tells that story, profiling the ornithologists, engineers, and other researchers who have worked to uncover migrationâ\x80\x99s secrets and the innovative methods theyâ\x80\x99ve developed to do so. Here are nine amazing facts about migrating birds and the people who study them.', 'Seventeenth-century minister and educator Charles Morton proposed the theory that birds were traveling to the moon and back when they disappeared and reappeared with the seasons. As wild as that sounds today, some of his ideas hit surprisingly close to the truthâ\x80\x94he speculated that changes in weather and food availability might prompt birds to head for greener (more lunar?) pastures, and even guessed that body fat might help sustain them on their journey.', 'In 1822, a hunter in Germany shot a stork that turned out to have an enormous spear embedded in its neck. Analysis of the wood and iron in the spear proved it was made in Africa, and the unfortunate bird had carried it from one continent to another before meeting its final end. This famous bird, dubbed the Pfeilstorch (German for â\x80\x9carrow storkâ\x80\x9d), is still on display in the University of Rostockâ\x80\x99s natural history museum in Germany.', 'Before the dawn of the digital era, scientists had to get creative to spy on migrating birds.

Another was recording the calls of birds passing overheadâ\x80\x94a pair of scientists working in the 1950s rigged up a tape recorder with bicycle axles to hold the 6000 feet of tape theyâ\x80\x99d need to record eight hours of calls [PDF].', 'Experiments with putting birds in planetariums have shown that they can orient themselves using the stars. The position of the sun during the day, the appearance of landmarks below, and some degree of genetic hard wiring all play a role as well.

Their hearts and flight muscles grow larger to power all that flying, and many of their other internal organs shrink temporarily, with portions of their digestive organs being reabsorbed into the body until theyâ\x80\x99re needed again. If they run out of fat, birds can even burn their own muscles for energy.', 'In 2007, a bar-tailed godwitâ\x80\x94a shorebird roughly the size of a footballâ\x80\x94was surgically implanted with a satellite transmitter while on its breeding grounds in Alaska. This transmitter let scientists track the bird, dubbed E7, as she embarked on her fall migration. She flew without stopping for eight days, crossing the full breadth of the Pacific Ocean, more than 7000 miles, before touching down in New Zealand. In November 2022, another bar-tailed godwit was tracked while making a nonstop journey of over 8000 miles from Alaska to Tasmania. ', 'Just because birds are famous for migration doesnâ\x80\x99t mean they all do it. Migration lets birds take advantage of resource booms that happen at different points on the globe at different times of year, but it also carries serious risks, exposing birds to physical stress and lack of food, predators, severe weather, and other threats.

Aron and his wife Elaine, who is also a psychologist, are known for studying what makes relationships beginâ\x80\x94and last.', 'In a 2016 study in Frontiers in Psychology, the researchers proposed that â\x80\x9cromantic love is a natural (and often positive) addiction that evolved from mammalian antecedents by 4 million years ago as a survival mechanism to encourage hominin pair-bonding and reproduction, seen cross-culturally today.â\x80\x9d', 'In the attraction phase, your body produces increased amounts of dopamine, the feel-good chemical that is also responsible for pain relief. Using fMRI brain imaging, Aronâ\x80\x99s studies have shown that â\x80\x9cif youâ\x80\x99re thinking about a person youâ\x80\x99re intensely in love with, your brain activates the dopamine reward system, which is the same system that responds to cocaine,â\x80\x9d he told Mental Floss in 2018.', 'Earlier, Fisherâ\x80\x99s 1997 paper found that new couples often show â\x80\x9cincreased energy, less need for sleep or food, focused attention and exquisite delight in smallest details of this novel relationship.â\x80\x9d', 'The attachment phase is characterized by increases in oxytocin and vasopressin; these hormones are thought to promote bonding and positive social behaviors to sustain connections over time in order to fulfill parental duties.', 'There is no hard and fast timeline for how long each phase lasts, as it can vary widely due to gender, age, and other environmental factors, Fisher writes.', 'Additionally, while oxytocin has long gotten the credit for being the love hormone, Prause said that scientists are now â\x80\x9ckind of over oxytocin,â\x80\x9d because it has broader functions than simply bonding. It also plays a role in the contraction of the uterus to stimulate birth, instigate lactation, and trigger sexual arousal; low levels have been linked to autism-spectrum disorders.', 'Now, theyâ\x80\x99re focusing on a charmingly named hormone known as kisspeptin. Produced in the hypothalamus, kisspeptin plays a role in the onset of puberty, and may increase libido, regulate the gonadal steroids that fuel the sex drive, and help the body maintain pregnancy. But Prause said there is a lot more to study about the role kisspeptin plays in attraction.', 'Biology may explain our initial attraction and the â\x80\x9choneymoonâ\x80\x9d phase of a relationship, but it doesnâ\x80\x99t necessarily explain why a personâ\x80\x99s love of obscure movies or joy of hiking tickles your fancy, or what makes you want to settle down.', 'The Aronsâ\x80\x99 numerous studies on this subject have found connection boils down to something quite simple: â\x80\x9cWhat makes people attracted to the point of falling in loveâ\x80\x94presuming the person is reasonably appropriate for themâ\x80\x94is that they feel the other person likes them,â\x80\x9d he said.', 'In the process of doing research for her book How To Fall in Love With Anyone, writer Mandy Len Catron of Vancouver became her own test subject when she came across the research the Arons are most well-known for: their 36 questions method, which promotes bonding.', 'The questions were originally designed to â\x80\x9cgenerate intimacy, a sense of feeling similar, and the sense that the other person likes you,â\x80\x9d Aron explains. Romantic love wasnâ\x80\x99t the goal. â\x80\x9cIt was a way of creating closeness between strangers.â\x80\x9d', 'The Arons first tested their questions by pairing up students during a regular class section of a large psychology course, as they related in a 2016 paper in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. Some students were paired with someone of the same sex, while others were matched with someone of the opposite sex. Each partner then answered a series of 36 increasingly personal questions, which took about 45 minutes each. (Question 2: â\x80\x9cWould you like to be famous? In what way?â\x80\x9d Question 35: â\x80\x9cOf all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?â\x80\x9d) Small talk during class hadnâ\x80\x99t made them bond, but the questions made the students feel closer.', 'In another version of the study, heterosexual, opposite-sex pairs follow the 36-question session with four minutes of staring deeply into each otherâ\x80\x99s eyes.', 'Catron decided to test these methods out with a casual acquaintance, Mark, over beers at a local bar one night. They were both dating other people at the time, and no one exclusively. As she answered the questions and listened to Markâ\x80\x99s answers, â\x80\x9cI felt totally absorbed by the conversation in a way that was unlike any of the other first dates I was having at the time with people I met online,â\x80\x9d Catron told Mental Floss in 2018.', 'She was ready to skip the four minutes of soulful eye gazing, but Mark thought they should try it. â\x80\x9cIt was deeply uncomfortable, but it was also an important part of the experience,â\x80\x9d she recalls. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s so intimate, it requires you to let your guard down.â\x80\x9d', 'The process instilled in Catron a deep feeling of trust in Mark and a desire to know him better. Within three months, they began dating in earnest. More than three years later, they were living together in a condo they bought.', 'The Aronsâ\x80\x99 questions offer â\x80\x9caccelerated intimacy,â\x80\x9d she said, in a time of increasingly online-driven dating experiences.', 'Despite all that weâ\x80\x99ve learned, scientists may only ever be able to brush up against the edge of a true understanding of â\x80\x9cchemistry.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cWe understand a fair amount about what happens when [attraction has] already occurred, but weâ\x80\x99re really bad at predicting when it will happen,â\x80\x9d Prause said. â\x80\x9cPeople who try to claim magical matchmaking, or that theyâ\x80\x99re going to somehow chemically manipulate an aphrodisiac or somethingâ\x80\x94well good luck!

195,11 Facts About the Animals of Chernobyl ,"['animals', 'dogs', 'environment', 'genetics', 'lists', 'nature', 'news', 'science', 'youtube channel', 'YouTube', 'video']","['Almost four decades after the Chernobyl disasterâ\x80\x94the worldâ\x80\x99s worst nuclear accidentâ\x80\x94signs of life are returning to the exclusion zone. Wild animals in Chernobyl are flourishing within the contaminated region; puppies roaming the area are capturing the hearts of thousands. Tourists who have watched the critically acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl are taking selfies with the ruins. Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in Jurassic Park, finds a way.', 'A faulty design and improperly trained workers are two of the precipitating factors that led to an explosion in Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986. The disaster devastated the environment: The total amount of radioactive material eventually released was hundreds of times higher than seen in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. ', 'Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disasterâ\x80\x99s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods: the Red Forest. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to shoot any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another 20,000 years, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.', 'As WIRED points out, the Chernobyl disaster presents an unintended experiment in what Earth would be like without humans. Hunting is strictly illegal and living within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is not recommended. The fewer humans there are, the more nature can re-establish itself unencumbered by human activity. According to The Guardian, an official nature reserve recently created on the Belorussian side of the zone claims to be â\x80\x9cEuropeâ\x80\x99s largest experiment in rewilding,â\x80\x9d where animals are losing their fear of humans. In fact, a few species are actually living better within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone than outside of it. ', 'According to biologist Jim Beasley, the population of large mammals in the exclusion zone has surpassed the numbers found before the near-meltdown. Bears, wolves, lynx, bison, deer, moose, beavers, foxes, badgers, wild boar, and raccoon dogs are just some of the species that have seemed to find a happy home in the radioactive area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria make the unpopulated environment their home.', 'A constant dose of low-level radiation obviously isnâ\x80\x99t beneficial, but it may be the caseâ\x80\x94for some animals, at leastâ\x80\x94that it isnâ\x80\x99t deleterious enough to outweigh the pre-disaster impact of human beings encroaching on habitats and actively hunting wildlife.', 'Wolves, in particular, may benefit from their propensity to travel great distances, giving them the opportunity to dilute the amount of radiation consumed during hunting. Beasley pegged the population density of the Chernobyl wolves as significantly higher than that found in Americaâ\x80\x99s Yellowstone National Park.Â\xa0The biologist told National Geographic that â\x80\x9chumans have been removed from the system and this greatly overshadows any of those potential radiation effects.â\x80\x9d', 'The Smithsonianâ\x80\x99s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute called Przewalskiâ\x80\x99s horses â\x80\x9cthe last truly wild horse.â\x80\x9d Other species sometimes referred to as wild, like the kind you might find on the United Statesâ\x80\x99 Assateague Island National Seashore, are properly classified as feral domestic horsesâ\x80\x94they descend from horses that escaped domestication. Whether Przewalski horsesâ\x80\x94also called Takhiâ\x80\x94can truly be called a wild species or subspecies is actually a matter of some debate. But whatâ\x80\x99s clear is that a once-large population that ranged across large swaths of Asia and Europe was eventually reduced to almost nothing. When Lee Boyd and Katherine A. Houpt edited a book about the animal in 1994, the most recent wild sighting had occurred in the late â\x80\x9860s, leading the authors to declare them â\x80\x9cextinct in the wild.â\x80\x9d', 'But British ecologists Mike Wood and Nick Beresford, who specialize in studying the effects of radiation on Chernobylâ\x80\x99s wildlife, observed that the Przewalskiâ\x80\x99s horse is thriving within the CEZ. In the late 1990s, about 30 Przewalskiâ\x80\x99s horses were released in the Ukrainian side of the CEZ, and that population has increased to more than 200. Based on camera trap images, Wood estimated that some of the original horses (identified by their brand markings) are still alive. Photos of juvenile horses and foals also indicated that the population is expanding. ', 'In contrast to large carnivores and other big fauna, insects and spiders have seen a big drop in their numbers. A 2009 study in Biology Letters indicated that the more radiation there was in certain locations around the Chernobyl disaster area, the lower the population of invertebrates. A similar phenomenon occurred after the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Bird, cicada, and butterfly populations decreased, while other animal populations were not affected.', 'Scientists have noted significant genetic changes in organisms affected by the disaster: According to a 2011 study in Biological Conservation, Chernobyl-caused genetic mutations in plants and animals increased by a factor of 20. Among breeding birds in the region, rare species suffered disproportional effects from the explosionâ\x80\x99s radiation compared to common species. Further research is needed to understand how the increased mutations affect speciesâ\x80\x99 reproductive rates, population size, genetic diversity, and other survival factors.', 'In 2018, scientist Michael Byrne tracked a wolf traveling a great distanceâ\x80\x94ultimately outside of the Exclusion Zoneâ\x80\x94and wondered whether the disproportionately high number of mutations in the Chernobyl animals could be passed on to other populations. Byrne struck an even-handed chord regarding his speculation: â\x80\x9cI donâ\x80\x99t want to say that animals from Chernobyl are contaminating the world. But if there are any forms of mutations that could be passed on, itâ\x80\x99s a thing to consider.â\x80\x9d', 'That doesnâ\x80\x99t mean thereâ\x80\x99s a bunch of three-eyed fish or two-headed cows in the Exclusion Zone, though. In 2016, footage of some very large catfish in the cooling pond of the Chernobyl reactor spread online, leading some to conclude that the radiation had supercharged the fishesâ\x80\x99 growth. Itâ\x80\x99s doubtful that the mutations caused by radiation, though, would lead to a larger overall size. These types of mutations generally decrease an animalâ\x80\x99s fitness and ability to grow to full size, let alone some kind of Hulk-like supersize. The explanation for the large catfish was actually quite simple: some fish are just really big.Â\xa0', 'There have been some oddities recorded within the area, and tour guides tell visitors not to pet Chernobyl animals due to potential radioactive particles in their fur, but todayâ\x80\x99s wild animals are sporting their normal number of limbs and arenâ\x80\x99t glowing. It seems that the most dramatic genetic mutations occurred immediately after the explosion at Reactor Four, consistent with what weâ\x80\x99ve observed in human beings. About 30 people died within months of the original explosion, primarily from acute radiation syndrome. Longer-term deaths related to the disaster are a matter of considerable debate, though there is evidence that thyroid cancer rates were elevated in people (especially children) exposed to Chernobylâ\x80\x99s radiationâ\x80\x94possibly through contaminated food. Perhaps surprisingly, a study published in the journal Science showed that parents who experienced genetic mutations as a result of radiation exposure did not pass those mutations on to their children.Â\xa0', 'It makes some sense that the biggest impacts would be felt in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, given how radiation works. Over the years, some of the potentially harmful radionuclides released by the blast have decayed, presumably making the area less dangerous to live in. Uncontrolled iodine-131 exposure, for example, is known to increase the risk of thyroid disease, including cancer. But it has a halflife of only eight days, and would have basically disappeared from the zone within a few months.Â\xa0', 'Other radioactive isotopes are still present in significant quantities. Cesium-137, for example, has a half life of over 30 years. And some animals are disproportionately affected: One risk factor is the animalâ\x80\x99s diet. Voles, for example, are a type of adorable little rodent that likes to eat a lot of mushrooms. Unfortunately, some mushroom species happen to be particularly good at concentrating radiation, passing on the harmful material to hungry voles. And they seem to demonstrate the harmful effects of radiation in a number of ways: The critters were shown to be less fertile in areas with higher concentrations of radiation, with a corresponding drop in overall populations. They were also shown to have higher rates of cataracts than animals from outside the Exclusion Zone. ', 'Barn swallows in the area were shown to demonstrate elevated levels of partial albinism, presumably a result of radiation-related genetic mutations. Areas with higher levels of radiation also seemingly gave rise to bird populations with smaller brains, less viable sperm, and decreased species diversity and abundance. So the story of Chernobylâ\x80\x99s animals isnâ\x80\x99t a simple one of the land returning to some kind of fecund paradise, but it also isnâ\x80\x99t the barren wasteland you might have imagined.', 'Hundreds of poochesâ\x80\x94the descendants of dogs abandoned by their owners during the siteâ\x80\x99s evacuation on April 27, 1986â\x80\x94have made the desolate area their home. Now, an organization called the Clean Future Fund helps conduct sterilization campaigns in the area. They also provide medical care, vaccinations, and even food to the Chernobyl pups (and cats).Â\xa0', 'Back in 2018 and 2019, a number of dogs were identified as having safe levels of radiation, and a few dozen were actually adopted. As of mid-2022, it seemed that the combination of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have disrupted the organizationâ\x80\x99s efforts, though they do continue to do occasional work in the Exclusion Zone.', 'Some of the Chernobyl dogs have been adopted by people who live in the Exclusion Zone.Â\xa0Despite laws ostensibly prohibiting it, there are actually a number of human beings living in the Exclusion Zone, some with tacit permission from authorities. These residents are called Samosely, or self settlers. Theyâ\x80\x99re mostly seniors, mostly women, and mostly lived in the area before the nuclear disaster. For any number of reasons, the Samosely have decided that the potential risks of radiation are outweighed by other considerationsâ\x80\x94financial, cultural, and geopoliticalâ\x80\x94that called them to the area.', 'This story is an adaptation of a previously published post (which ran in 2019) and an episode of The List Show on YouTube and has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/586059/chernobyl-animal-facts

Defined as a wave caused by a disturbance like an earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption, tsunamis often reach just a few inches in height, according to NOAA. But when the inciting event is strong enough, the results can be disastrous. The most powerful tsunamis move as fast as jet planes across the open ocean and grow as tall as skyscrapers. When they reach land, they can decimate entire towns in minutes.', 'The tsunamis on this list arenâ\x80\x99t necessarily the deadliest or most destructive, but they do dominate one category: sheer magnitude. Here are the tallest megatsunamis ever recorded.', ""Greenland rarely sees tsunamis, but it was hit by one of the biggest waves on record in 2017. A landslide on Karrat Fjord sent a 295-foot-tall wall of water into the fishing village of Nuugaatsiaq on June 17. The megatsunami killed four people and swept 11 buildings into the ocean. Experts believe the event was triggered by a warming climate thawing the glacial landscape. The mountains surrounding Karrat Fjord are still unstable, and an even bigger landslide-caused tsunami could be in Greenland's future."", 'The first megatsunami to be documented in detail in Indonesia remains one of the largest tsunamis on record. On February 17, 1674, an earthquake struck the Maluku Islands in the Banda Sea. The seismic event sent a massive wave crashing into Ambon Island, where it killed more than 2000 people. The water reached the top of the coastal hills on the Hitu Peninsula, indicating the tsunami peaked around 328 feet.', 'This megatsunami that hit the T-shaped fjord on the southeastern edge of Alaska was likely caused by a landslide. Tree ring counts show it occurring in late 1853 or early 1854, and trimlines [PDF] (the point in the valley where trees were wiped away) indicate a maximum height of 394 feet. Lituya Bay has been the site of multiple megastunamis throughout history.

Eyewitnesses described three giant waves rolling in from Crillon Inlet one after the other at speeds around 22 mph [PDF]. The largest wave topped out at around 490 feet. Experts still arenâ\x80\x99t sure what caused the 1936 tsunami, but an underwater rockslide is one possible culprit.', 'The remote fjord of Icy Bay, Alaska, saw a historic megatsunami on October 17, 2015. Following a landslide, the 633-foot wave cleared 8 square miles of forest from Wrangell St.-Elias National Park and Preserve. Fortunately, no humans were close enough to be impacted by the event. Like Lituya Bay, Icy Bay features steep walls carved out by a retreating glacier, which contributed to the tsunamiâ\x80\x99s intensity.', 'Unlike other tsunamis on this list, this disaster was caused by humans. The construction of the Vajont dam in northern Italyâ\x80\x94the highest dam of its kind at the time of completion in 1960â\x80\x94disturbed the surrounding landscape.

198,10 Little-Known Facts About Inventor Elijah McCoy,"['trains', 'design', 'engineering', 'inventions', 'Black History Month', 'science']","['Elijah McCoyâ\x80\x99s most famous creation, an automatic oil cup that lubricated steam engines on trains, may have spawned the phrase the real McCoy. He patented over 50 inventions, more than any other Black man held at the turn of the 20th centuryâ\x80\x94and most of them related to railroads. McCoy was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2001 and was the subject of a Google doodle on his birthday in 2022. Here are nine more facts about the prolific inventor.', 'McCoyâ\x80\x99s parents made their way from Kentucky to Ontario, Canada, where Elijah was born on May 2, 1844. He had 11 brothers and sisters. Elijah spent the earliest days of his childhood on a 160-acre homestead there before the family returned to the States when McCoy was 3. They lived in Detroit and then in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where McCoyâ\x80\x99s father, George, opened a tobacco business.', 'Elijah had an obvious aptitude for taking apart and rebuilding machines. His parents saved enough money to send him to the University of Edinburgh to be trained in mechanical engineering, but when he returned to the States shortly after the Civil War, he found slim prospects as a Black engineer. Instead, he got a job as a fireman/oilman on the Michigan Central Railroad, shoveling coal onto fires that powered the steam locomotivesâ\x80\x99 engines.', 'Another part of his job involved oiling the axles and bearings on the trainsâ\x80\x99 wheels as well parts of the engine, a cumbersome process that required trains to stop frequently for service, which delayed shipments, wasted fuel, and wore down the machinery. McCoy was determined to solve this inefficiency. He designed a cup-like apparatus that provided a continuous drip of oil into the locomotive parts while the train was moving, and received U.S. patent number 129,843 in 1872. McCoyâ\x80\x99s automatic oil cup was a huge success; as some stories tell it, knock-offs quickly entered the market, and when a company wanted to make sure it bought the original design, it asked for the â\x80\x9creal McCoy.â\x80\x9d', 'Because the automatic oil cup allowed gears and moving parts to be lubricated while in motion, other industries that previously had to stop their equipment for servicing naturally wanted to adopt it. It soon made its way into oil-drilling and mining equipment, factories, naval vessels, construction, and factory tools, among other applications.', 'Despite the acclaim that the oil cup received, McCoy considered his greatest invention to be a graphite lubricator that he patented in 1915 at the age of 72. McCoy mixed graphite and oil to create a more viscous lubricant that could be used with modern locomotive engines, which ran hotter; the substance allowed engines to move smoothly and reduced the amount of coal and oil needed to operate the trains.', 'Most of McCoyâ\x80\x99s inventions related to the railroad, but he devised others that most laypeople would recognize. Although he is often credited with inventing the lawn sprinkler, McCoy actually improved upon an existing model. Another Black inventor, Joseph H. Smith, patented a sprinkler design in May of 1897; and an earlier version, by Joseph Lessler, was patented in 1871. McCoyâ\x80\x99s design, shaped like a turtle and dispersing the water in a different way, was patented in 1899. McCoy also patented a new portable, foldable ironing board in response to his wifeâ\x80\x99s complaints about hers.', 'McCoy worked in Detroit as a railroad consultant to engineering firms beginning in 1882, then opened the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company in 1920, making his products himself instead of licensing the designs.', 'McCoy was married twice, first to Ann Elizabeth Stewart (who died in 1872), and then to Mary Eleanora Delaney in 1873. Elijah McCoy had no surviving children in either marriage.', 'Mary McCoy made her own mark as a well-known civic leader and suffragist in the Detroit area. She was the only Black member of the Twentieth Century Club of Detroit, a prominent womenâ\x80\x99s social club, and in 1895 founded the first Black womanâ\x80\x99s club with the unwieldy name In As Much Circle of Kings Daughters and Sons. She was instrumental in establishing the Phyllis Wheatley Home for Aged Colored Women in Detroit and the Michigan chapter of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). She was active in a number of other prominent organizations and suffrage movements as well.', 'Although McCoyâ\x80\x99s inventions reportedly generated millions of dollars, McCoy himself netted only a small fraction of that, and lost what he did earn.

199,Raisin' Hellbenders: How Scientists Are Saving North America's Largest Salamander,"['animals', 'science', 'environment']","['Sherri Doro Reinsch stands in the river and bends over one of the gray coolers filling the canoe. She reaches inside and untwists a long plastic bag containing a mottled brown creature submerged in waterâ\x80\x94an eastern hellbender. Under the burning Tennessee summer sun, Reinsch and her colleagues prepare to release 11 of these native salamanders, each implanted with a transmitter allowing the team to track them.', 'Once commonly found in the eastern United States, these salamandersâ\x80\x94which are the largest in North Americaâ\x80\x94are now struggling to survive. Yet, unlike their relatives, the Ozark hellbenders, eastern hellbenders as a whole are not listed as federally endangered; only a specific population in Missouri is protected.', 'Reinschâ\x80\x94the Nashville Zooâ\x80\x99s lead amphibian and reptile keeperâ\x80\x94and her colleagues from the zoo, Tennessee State University, and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency are trying to save the eastern hellbenders through an innovative program in which they raise the animals from eggs until theyâ\x80\x99re old enough to be returned to the wild.', 'From egg cluster to fully grown amphibian, hellbenders spend their entire lives in the water. A female can lay up to 500 eggs at once, and after the eggs hatch, the animals stay with their father (known as the denmaster) before the tiny young hellbenders spend a year living in the gravel of the riverbed feeding on insect larvae. They then metamorphose into adult hellbenders.Â\xa0', 'But too many hellbenders arenâ\x80\x99t surviving these early life stages. The process where the young grow and join the adult population, replacing the old, is known as recruitmentâ\x80\x94and hellbenders suffer from a lack of recruitment. Dale McGinnity, a hellbender expert and Nashville Zoo curator of insects, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, believes hellbender populations began declining in the middle of the 1980s. Over a decade later, populations outside of national parks had shrunk by 90 percent.Â\xa0', ""Scientists arenâ\x80\x99t entirely sure whatâ\x80\x99s causing the lack of recruitment, but they do know whatâ\x80\x99s not. â\x80\x9cWe're quite sure that itâ\x80\x99s not the sperm or the eggs because we can find viable nests,â\x80\x9d McGinnity tells Mental Floss, â\x80\x9cwhich is really nice, because we can collect eggs and head-start themâ\x80\x94which is what weâ\x80\x99re doing.â\x80\x9d"", 'The head start program began in 2015. The 11 hellbenders scientists are preparing to release today, which were captured as eggs in central Tennessee, are part of the second class. Scientists take a portion of a female hellbenderâ\x80\x99s egg clutch from a local waterway, hand-raise them past the point where theyâ\x80\x99d die in the wild, and then release them to the same area.', 'For almost seven years, the scientists cared for these hellbenders at the zoo, preparing them for life in the river theyâ\x80\x99re now standing in (its name and location are kept secret to protect the animals). They regularly introduced river water to their tanks and fed them crayfishâ\x80\x94their main food sourceâ\x80\x94from the same waterway. Now the biologists hope these amphibians, which can grow over 2 feet long and weigh five pounds, can complete their full lifespan here. Hellbenders in captivity have lived for almost 30 years, but itâ\x80\x99s thought they might live 50 years or more in the wild.Â\xa0', 'After getting in the river, Reinsch tested the waterâ\x80\x99s temperature, a factor in the hellbendersâ\x80\x99 ability to breathe. â\x80\x9cColder water has more dissolved oxygen in it â\x80¦ so it makes [it] easier to breathe because they absorb oxygen through their skin,â\x80\x9d Reinsch tells Mental Floss. To allow the hellbenders to adjust to their new home, the scientists pull each hellbender in its bag of tank water out of the coolers and hold the bags by their sides in the current, like pets on a leash. Eventually, they let a little water inside, slowly introducing the hellbenders to the new temperature.', 'And about that name: Thereâ\x80\x99s no definitive consensus on its origin. Some scientists believe itâ\x80\x99s because of their appearance, because they are active at night, or because they can bend from side to side. Their even more evocative nickname, â\x80\x9csnot otters,â\x80\x9d stems from the mucus they produce all over their bodies to ward off predators.Â\xa0', 'Because they need clean, flowing water to survive, many consider hellbenders â\x80\x9ccanaries in the coal mineâ\x80\x9d: Their wellbeing is an indication of the overall health of the waterways on which other species also depend. And that could provide a clue as to whatâ\x80\x99s causing hellbendersâ\x80\x99 lack of recruitment.Â\xa0', 'Chemicals polluting these waterways may be a cause of their decline. One theory is that agricultural chemicals could be flowing into the water and harming the hellbenders as they metamorphose, preventing them from reaching healthy adulthood. The harmful substances could also be accumulating in the young insects that the larval hellbenders eat, which also might affect their metamorphosis.Â\xa0', 'Sediment flowing into rivers is another possible obstacle to recruitment among hellbender populations. Hellbenders are extremely picky about their nest rocks: They must be several feet wide and completely embedded on all sides except for a small hole leading to a space underneath the rock. If too much sediment enters the water, it can fill up this entranceway, and eggs inside that space wonâ\x80\x99t survive. Suitable nesting habitat can also be damaged or destroyed if humans move or stack rocks in rivers.', 'In addition to its head start program, the Nashville Zoo has a hellbender breeding program as part of its conservation efforts. In 2012, the zoo was the first to successfully breed eastern hellbenders. McGinnity and his team are now working on finding the most cost-efficient methods for this workâ\x80\x94including cryopreserving sperm and artificial fertilizationâ\x80\x94that also promote genetic diversity, a key to a healthy population. One day they hope to perfect the process of hatching and raising hellbenders so they can supplement wild populations with strong, genetically diverse babies. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s a tough thing to figure out because they only breed once a year, and we have a really limited number of animals to work with,â\x80\x9d McGinnity says. â\x80\x9cBut weâ\x80\x99ve made a lot of headway.â\x80\x9d', 'Sometimes the hellbenders donâ\x80\x99t actually go along with this plan, though. Usually, after a female lays the eggs and the male fertilizes them, only he stays to ensure the flow of oxygen-rich water over the nest. McGinnity remembers a particular male hellbender guarding eggs in their lab; the researcher was hopeful heâ\x80\x99d end up with a healthy batch of hellbenders until the male ate the eggs. (This sometimes happens in the wild, too, for unknown reasons.)', 'Reinsch and her colleagues have chosen an idyllic new home for their hellbenders. A tall bluff, its gray rock peeping through the green of the trees and vines growing in its crevices, guards one side of the river, and lush forest hugs the other side as the sun shines down on the sparkling clear water. Itâ\x80\x99s fitting that these last moments with the creatures they raised are surrounded by such natural beauty; from then on, they would only be connected by technology, as the scientists depend on radio signals from the hellbendersâ\x80\x99 transmitters to find them again.', 'Donning snorkeling gear, the scientists take turns releasing the hellbenders. Each lifts one out of its bag, cradling it gently before sinking below the waterâ\x80\x99s surface, holding the hellbender up to a specially chosen nest rock, and releasing it into the entrance hole. Thirty-four hellbenders were released this way during the summer of 2022, and months later, over half of the released amphibians have survived, an improvement over the previous year.', 'Before they release another group of hellbenders, the team will review what theyâ\x80\x99ve learned and what they should change. Reinsch likes to share their knowledge with any interested party. â\x80\x9cWe all want to do â\x80¦ what will work out to be the best [practice],â\x80\x9d she says. â\x80\x9cWe all have the same passion for hellbenders.â\x80\x9d', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/eastern-hellbender-salamander-conservation

201,Why Snow Removal Is Such a Hard Problem to Solve,"['Snow', 'news', 'weather', 'science']","['The difference of a few degrees in temperature is enough to cause a logistical nightmare for towns and cities each winter. While rain that falls on roads and sidewalks tends to wash away on its own, snow canâ\x80\x99t be ignored. In New York City, the cost of keeping roadways clear can add up to $12 million per inch of snow. ', 'The video below from the YouTube channel Half as Interesting explains what makes the science of snow removal so complicated. Using large trucks to plow away powder is one of the most common methods, but itâ\x80\x99s not perfect. These vehicles move at speeds of 25 to 35 mph. Going any faster isnâ\x80\x99t effective, plus it endangers the lives of any nearby pedestrians. Snowplows need to drive over the same stretch of road multiple times to clear it, which makes the process of keeping roads safe for drivers both arduous and expensive. ', 'One way municipalities ease this pain is by reducing the amount of snow that accumulates on streets to begin with. Salt solutions do this by lowering the freezing point of water from 32Â°F to 20Â° at most. That helps prevent snow and ice from forming on the roads, but it adds the new problem of road salt contaminating the environment and water supply. For this reason some mountain towns have looked into alternative ice-prevention tricks, including heating their streets and coating them in beet juice. ', 'Blizzards may be a headache today, but the science of snow removal has come a long way. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the only way to get around after a snowstorm was with snowshoes or a sleigh.

Too few tourists and history fans, however, know that our nationâ\x80\x98s capital might have been a very different place if not for the surveying work of Benjamin Bannekerâ\x80\x94a highly accomplished mathematician, astronomer, and scholar who challenged Thomas Jefferson and his peers to recognize African-American achievement when it was right under their noses (and feet).', 'Benjamin Banneker was born November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Robert and Mary Banneker. While scholars still debate almost all the specifics of his background and early life, the most popular story suggests both sides of his family were enslaved. Although records are scarce, itâ\x80\x98s said that Benjaminâ\x80\x99s maternal grandmother, a white woman named Mollie Welsh, was falsely convicted of theft in England and sentenced to indentured servitude in the colony of Maryland (not an uncommon practice at the time). After earning her freedom, she rented land in Baltimore County and purchased two enslaved people to help farm it. Several years later, after the farming operation was established, she freed both men.', 'One of them, who is said to have been abducted from a royal family in Africa earlier in his life, displayed a keen interest in astronomy and other scientific subjects. He was called Bannake or Bankka, and Mollie Welsh married him, violating a law that forbid marriage to enslaved people. Later, their daughter Mary and her husbandâ\x80\x94a Guinean man who had been enslaved, baptized with the name Robert, and then freedâ\x80\x94chose to adopt the surname Banneker at the time of their own marriage. Just a few years after regaining his freedom, records show that Robert was able to purchase a 100-acre farm (possibly the same one his mother-in-law rented), where his family would live out much of their lives and where his sonâ\x80\x99s scholarship would bloom.', 'Benjamin Banneker grew up as one of only 200 free African Americans among 13,000 whites and 4000 enslaved people in Baltimore County. His experience with formal instruction was limited to a brief stretch in a one-room Quaker schoolhouse that taught both Black and white students, but he was a keen study from his earliest years. Perhaps with his doting grandmother Mollieâ\x80\x99s help, he learned to read and soon became especially interested in mathematics and mechanics, often performing calculations and experiments on his own.', 'Once he was old enough to work on the family farm, Banneker settled into a lifestyle that combined this work with scholarly achievement. After his fatherâ\x80\x99s death when Banneker was 27, he continued running the farm with his mother and sisters. The horses, cows, garden, and multiple beehives he kept enabled a simple, comfortable life for the family, according to one 19th-century account presented to the Maryland Historical Society. Using crop rotation and irrigation techniques that wouldnâ\x80\x99t catch on in the U.S. for many decades, he also raised profitable tobacco crops that were sold alongside his produce in the Ellicott familyâ\x80\x99s store. Taking heed of food shortages during the Revolutionary War, Banneker also swapped tobacco out for wheat to help feed American soldiers.', 'Throughout his life, biographer Elizabeth Ross Haynes wrote in 1921, Banneker â\x80\x9cfound time to study all the books which he could borrow.â\x80\x9d He became well-versed in topics throughout the sciences and humanities. The 19th-century account presented to the Maryland Historical Society remembered Banneker as â\x80\x9can acute observer, whose active mind was constantly receiving impulses from what was taking place around him.â\x80\x9d', 'For example, in a rather illustrative 1797 journal entry, Banneker wrote:', 'â\x80\x9cStanding at my door I heard the discharge of a gun, and in four or five seconds of time, after the discharge, the small shot came rattling about me, one or two of which struck the house; which plainly demonstrates that the velocity of sound is greater than that of a cannon bullet.â\x80\x9d', 'Some historians have speculated that Bannekerâ\x80\x99s many childhood lessons with his grandmother Mollie, who may have gained a sophisticated understanding of astronomy from Bannake, could have fostered his particular expertise with the subject. However, it was his prowess with mathematics for which he first became renowned throughout Baltimore County, according to a 1912 article. As word spread of his exceptional skills, far-away scholars began sending Banneker complex mathematical problems, and they continued to do so throughout his life. Banneker reportedly always solved them, often responding in verse and with a fresh problem.', 'As a young man, Banneker also gained fame and admiration for miles around due to one of his earliest known mechanical feats: building a working clock almost entirely out of wood from scratch. It may have been the first clock ever assembled completely from American parts, according to Haynes (although other historians have since disputed this). Banneker reportedly had only a borrowed pocket watch to use for reference on clockwork mechanisms, while his wooden version contained functioning, carved-to-scale components. The clock continued working until a few days after Bannekerâ\x80\x99s death, when a fire destroyed his cabin home and many of its contentsâ\x80\x94clock included.', 'However, Bannekerâ\x80\x99s accomplished scholarship remained mostly unknown outside the region until he encountered the Ellicott family. In 1772, the Ellicotts purchased the land next door to Bannekerâ\x80\x99s and began building new gristmill facilities there. Bannekerâ\x80\x99s fascination with the millâ\x80\x99s mechanics made him a frequent visitor to the site. In keeping with their Quaker traditions, the Ellicotts were adamant proponents of racial equality, and they collaborated with Banneker as well as encouraged wider application ofâ\x80\x94and recognition forâ\x80\x94his unique skills.', 'George Ellicott, a close friend of Bannekerâ\x80\x99s for decades, was himself a student of astronomy and eagerly shared both his resources and queries with his neighbor. Banneker took great advantage of the borrowed tools and books in performing exquisite astronomical calculations, such as predicting a solar eclipse nearly to the exact moment in 1789. He also began building the foundations for several atlases and technical treatises heâ\x80\x99d release in the decades before his death. In 1791, Georgeâ\x80\x99s cousin, Major Andrew Ellicott, gave Banneker a national stage, after Andrew had gone to George requesting help with a new job. George, being otherwise busy, suggested Bannekerâ\x80\x98s assistance. The job was surveying land along the Potomac River for what would soon be the nationâ\x80\x99s capital, Washington, D.C.', 'The plans for the city were laid out by French architect and engineer Pierre Charles Lâ\x80\x99Enfant, who volunteered for service in the American Revolutionâ\x80\x99s Continental Army and was hired for the project by George Washington in 1791. Before long, however, tensions mounted over the direction and progress of the project, and when Lâ\x80\x99Enfant was fired in 1792, he took off with the plans.', 'But, according to legend, the plans werenâ\x80\x99t actually lost: Banneker and the Ellicotts had worked closely with Lâ\x80\x99Enfant and his plans while surveying the cityâ\x80\x99s future site. Banneker had actually committed the plans to memory and could redraw the full blueprint, down to the street grid, major buildings, and open spaces. Some historians argue, however, that Banneker had no involvement in this part of the survey at all, instead saying that Andrew and his brother were the ones who recreated Lâ\x80\x99Enfantâ\x80\x99s plan. Itâ\x80\x98s an intriguing myth, but it may only be that.', 'Yet Bannekerâ\x80\x99s valuable contributions to the project drew attention, and set the stage for later correspondence with Thomas Jefferson. During the project, the Georgetown Weekly Ledger made public note of Banneker as â\x80\x9can Ethiopian, whose abilities, as a surveyor, and an astronomer, clearly prove that Mr. Jeffersonâ\x80\x98s concluding that race of men were void of mental endowments, was without foundation.â\x80\x9d', 'In 1791, Banneker had finished his â\x80\x9cpainstakingly calculated ephemeris,â\x80\x9d or table of the position of celestial bodies, which he would publish alongside charts, literature, and humanitarian and political essays in six almanacs with 28 editions in the following six years. Upon its initial completion, he first sent a copy of the ephemeris to then-secretary of state Thomas Jefferson, along with a famously direct, yet perfectly polite, letter challenging Jeffersonâ\x80\x99s opinion that African Americans bore an innate intellectual disadvantage compared to white Americans [PDF]. Among other things, Banneker observed:', 'â\x80\x9cI have long been convinced, that if your love for yourselves and for those inestimable laws, which preserved to you the rights of human nature, was founded on sincerity, you could not but be solicitous that every individual ... might with you equally enjoy the blessings thereof, neither could you rest satisfied [short of] their promotion from any state of degradation, to which the unjustifiable cruelty and barbarism of men may have reduced them.', 'Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge that I am of the African race ... and it is under a sense of the most profound gratitude to the supreme ruler of the Universe, that I now confess to you, that I am not under the state of tyrannical thraldom, and inhuman captivity to which many of my brethren are doomed, but that I have abundantly tasted of the fruition of those blessings, which proceed from that free and unequalled liberty, with which you are favored, and which, I hope you will willingly allow, you have received from the immediate hand of that being ... [and] that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy, you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blessing of heaven.â\x80\x9d', 'Jeffersonâ\x80\x99s letter in response was significantly shorter than Bannekerâ\x80\x99s, and not without traces of the mindset Banneker sought to defeat. But it also documented the scholarâ\x80\x99s triumph in gaining some respect for his accomplishments, and in helping to dislodge certain prejudices from the minds of the eraâ\x80\x99s most learned men.', 'On August 30, 1791, Jefferson wrote:', 'â\x80\x9cSIR,I THANK you, sincerely, for your letter of the 19th instant, and for the Almanac it contained. No body wishes more than I do, to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men ; and that the appearance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced, for raising the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstances, which cannot be neglected, will admit.', 'I have taken the liberty of sending your Almanac to Monsieur de Condozett, Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and Member of the Philanthropic Society, because I considered it as a document, to which your whole color had a right for their justification, against the doubts which have been entertained of them.', 'I am with great esteem, Sir, Your most obedient Humble Servant,THOMAS JEFFERSON.â\x80\x9d', 'The discrimination African Americans suffered from Jefferson and other bigwigs is well documented, and Bannekerâ\x80\x99s brave, considered opposition to it stands forever among his many admirable achievements.', 'Records suggest that lower-profile white Americans belittled and questioned his achievements as well. Despite the many pushbacks he withstood, however, Banneker remained curious and generous of spirit. According to A Sketch of the Life of Benjamin Banneker, â\x80\x9chis equilibrium was seldom disturbed by the petty jealousies and inequalities of temper of the ignorant people ... with whom his situation obliged him frequently to come in contact.â\x80\x9d', 'Benjamin Ellicott, who prepared extensive notes on Bannekerâ\x80\x99s life for the Maryland Historical Society, remembered him as such in a letter:', 'â\x80\x9cAlthough his mode of life was regular and extremely retired, living alone, having never married,--cooking his own victuals and washing his own clothes, and scarcely ever being absent from home, yet there was nothing misanthropic in his character â\x80¦ [He was known as] kind, generous, hospitable, humane, dignified and pleasant, abounding in information on all the various subjects and incidents of the day; very modest and unassuming, and delighting in society at his own home.â\x80\x9d', 'Given Bannekerâ\x80\x99s wide-ranging interests and enthusiasm, then, itâ\x80\x98s fitting that a variety of parks, schools, awards, streets, businesses, and other public and private institutions and facilities all bear his name today. Admirers can learn about the accomplished scholar at Benjamin Banneker Park in Washington, D.C., at Baltimoreâ\x80\x98s Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum, or at the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. Or, visitors can follow in his footsteps by exploring their passions and hobbies at community centers named for Banneker in Washington, D.C., Bloomington, Indiana; and Catonsville, Maryland. It seems possible, however, that the man himself might have been most fond ofâ\x80\x94or, at least, a very frequent visitor toâ\x80\x94Marylandâ\x80\x99s own Banneker Planetarium.', 'A version of this story ran in 2016; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/85984/retrobituaries-benjamin-banneker-african-american-mathematician-who-may-have-saved
205,8 Scientific Benefits of Love,"['Love', 'health', 'brain', 'science']","['One of the best descriptions of love comes from the 1998 movie Practical Magic, when Gillian (a witch played by Nicole Kidman) tells her nieces, â\x80\x9cYou ever put your arms out and spin really, really fast? â\x80¦ Well, thatâ\x80\x99s what love is like. It makes your heart race. It turns the world upside down.â\x80\x9d', 'Aside from that feeling of disorientation, love can also have some pretty great perksâ\x80\x94like mental and physical benefit to our bodies. Here are eight aspects of life that get a boost when our hearts are full.', 'You know that giddy, high-on-life feeling you get when youâ\x80\x99re totally smitten with someone youâ\x80\x99ve just started dating? Or the satisfying comfort of a long-lasting partnership? Those emotions may help you live longer. A 2017 study in the journal American Psychologist (reported by the Washington Post) found that if youâ\x80\x99re in a happy, committed relationship, you have a 49 percent lower all-cause mortality risk. Researchers attribute the bump in longevity to a couple things. First, happier people tend to end up in relationships more often. Second, partners have a tendency to nag each other to have healthier habits, such as eating a more nutritious diet or getting better sleep. Finallyâ\x80\x94a good use of nagging!', 'That nagging can have heart-healthy benefits, too. For a study in the JAMA Internal Medicine March 2015 issue, researchers set out to see if each half of a couple would be more likely to make positive health changes, like quitting smoking and increasing physical activity, if their partner does too. About half (48 percent) of men and 50 percent of women decided to quit smoking once their partner did. Two-thirds of both men and women kicked up their physical activity after their partner did the same. Research has shown that putting down the smokes and exercising more are two important ways to improve cardiovascular health.', 'Being in a relationship can be stressful, but if youâ\x80\x99re happily in committed coupledom, some of that stress will naturally melt away. And that often leads to lower blood pressure. A 2018 study in the journal Annals of Behavioral Medicine showed that this effect on blood pressure is unique to people in relationships. The study measured blood pressure differences when a couple was speaking to each other, versus when they were speaking to someone else. In most cases, happily coupled people had lower blood pressure when chatting with just one another. These results echo those of a similar study done in 2001â\x80\x94blood pressure was lower during partner conversations, likely because the conversations themselves were more focused on intimacy and emotional support.', 'Lower blood pressure has another great effect, too: reducing anxiety and depression. Another Annals of Behavioral Medicine study showed that when a couple has a happy partnership, theyâ\x80\x99re calmer. While this doesnâ\x80\x99t mitigate the chemical imbalance of clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, it does seem to soften the blow of stress across the board. Researchers believe the mental benefits here are due to the satisfaction and support happily coupled people receive. The study also pulled in the effects of other social relationships and found that a relationship partner still made the biggest difference.Â\xa0', 'When your heart is happy in a relationship, the effects can last yearsâ\x80\x94not just while youâ\x80\x99re in a couple. At the University of Minnesota, researchers wanted to see if good relationship experiences led to better sleep later in life. They interviewed 112 people when they were 23 about their relationships, and then interviewed them again when they were 32 about both relationships and stressful life events. Five years later, those same people discussed their quality and quantity of sleep. While sleep quantity didnâ\x80\x99t seem affected, the researchers found that those who had happier relationships when they were 23 had better quality sleep at 37. They also saw fewer stressful events in their lives.Â\xa0', 'People often refer to love as a drugâ\x80\x94and a study by the Stanford University School of Medicine found that the areas of the brain affected by love and drugs have a pretty big overlap. Both light up the dopamine centers in our brains, causing effective pain relief. Basically, if youâ\x80\x99re in love, youâ\x80\x99re likely to be in less pain than you would be otherwise. In the small study, researchers had college-age students bring in photos of the person they loved. The researchers then used computer-controlled thermal simulators to cause pain in the participantâ\x80\x99s hand. When the participant looked at the pictures they brought, the pain significantly reduced. It was almost as effective as painkillers.Â\xa0', 'If youâ\x80\x99re in love, you probably wonâ\x80\x99t get as many colds. Over a year, researchers from Tulane University and UCLA monitored a group of 47 women who were in new romantic relationships. They had regular blood draws and completed questionnaires to measure the immune system response to love. Essentially, feelings of love regulated the genes in the immune system, and when there was more love, people had fewer colds. Interestingly, the change in immune system genes also happens when the body is preparing for pregnancy.', 'In addition to the immune system boost, being in love can also help you heal. A study in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology showed that couples happily in love had their wounds resolve faster than those in unhappy relationships. Thirty-seven couples were given blister wounds on their forearms for the study. Then they were instructed to interact with one another.

Hereâ\x80\x99s what you need to know about the real life fungus behind the show ... including whether or not it could infect humans.', 'Cordycepsâ\x80\x94the name given to a genus of fungus in 1818 by Swedish mycologist E.M. Friesâ\x80\x94was created by combining the Ancient Greek word cordyle (ÎºÎ¿Ï\x81Î´Ï\x8dÎ»Î·), meaning â\x80\x9cclub,â\x80\x9d with the Latin word for â\x80\x9chead,â\x80\x9d caput. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this might be because of â\x80\x9cthe appearance of the fruiting bodies of these fungi, which have rounded ends and may be thought to resemble clubs.â\x80\x9d There are more than 400 species in the Cordyceps genus, and they can be found in forests all over the world.', 'When they were creating The Last of Us video game, Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley took inspiration from a nature documentaryâ\x80\x94specifically, the BBCâ\x80\x99s Planet Earth, â\x80\x9cwhere they talked about the [cordyceps] fungus and how it affects insects,â\x80\x9d Druckmann told VentureBeat in 2013.', 'In general, Cordyceps are parasites. As mycology expert and Miami University Professor Nicholas P. Money explains in Fungi: A Very Short Introduction, â\x80\x9cInsects and spiders are attacked by Cordyceps species that penetrate their exoskeletons, invade their soft tissues, and break out from the dead animal with club-shaped fruit bodies.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'But the more famous lifecycle that Druckmann and Straley were inspired by belongs to a Cordyceps cousin: Ophiocordyceps. An ant infected with spores of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, National Geographic explains, will â\x80\x9cleave its nest for a more humid microclimate thatâ\x80\x99s favorable to the fungusâ\x80\x99s growth. The ant is compelled to descend to a vantage point about 10 inches off the ground, sink its jaws into a leaf vein on the north side of a plant, and wait for death.â\x80\x9d', 'The fungus continues to grow, eating everything inside, until the insect finally diesâ\x80\x94at which point the fruit of the fungus will burst out of the antâ\x80\x99s head, sending fresh spores out into the air in search of new ants to infect. This has probably existed for quite awhile: Thereâ\x80\x99s evidence of the â\x80\x9cdeath-gripâ\x80\x9d on a 48-million-year-old leaf fossil.', 'The consensus among scientists seems to be that what Cordyceps does to humans in The Last of Us is something that would take millions of years to evolve, as the relationship between the fungus and insects has.', 'â\x80\x9cEverything in the human body is so different from the insects that these fungi normally infect, including our physiology, our nervous tissue, and our body temperature,â\x80\x9d mycologist and Utrecht University assistant professor Charissa de Bekker explained to Vox. â\x80\x9cEven if the fungi were able to cause a small infection, the machinery that is needed for the fungus to do such a precise manipulation is simply not there. â\x80¦ We donâ\x80\x99t see the fungi specialists just jumping from one ant species to another, let alone from an ant species to another insect. Spreading from ant to human is just such a big jump.â\x80\x9d', 'That said, there are funguses that could prove dangerous to humans, like the relatively recently discovered Candida auris, a yeast that is resistant to many antifungal medicines and can cause serious chronic infections and even death.', 'Scientists are looking at various specifies of Cordyceps fungus for potential health benefits ranging from aiding in the management of type 2 diabetes to slowing the growth of tumors and cancer cells to alleviating inflammation. Itâ\x80\x99s even sometimes used in kidney transplantsâ\x80\x94though as with many Cordyceps medical claims, better evidence is needed before scientists can say if it actually has a benefit. Cordyceps militaris, which can be cultivated in a lab, is used in a number of health supplements.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s also believed that Cordyceps has performance-enhancing abilities; the fungus (or a relatedÂ\xa0Ophiocordyceps) made news in 1993 when the coach of Chinaâ\x80\x99s womenâ\x80\x99s running team said his athletesâ\x80\x94who broke several records at the World Championships in Athletics that yearâ\x80\x94had been taking the fungus.', 'In parts of the Tibetan Plateau, Ophiocordyceps sinensis takes over the larvae of ghost moths. The caterpillar and its resulting fungal spore, known as Yartsa Gunbu (it also goes by a number of other transliterations, including Yarchagumba, and means â\x80\x9csummer grass, winter wormâ\x80\x9d), is one of the rarest and most expensive fungi on Earth: According to some estimates it can cost around $20,000 for a just couple of pounds, leading to an apt nickname: Himalayan Gold.

Using 15 silicone tongues with tiny papillae and pig stomach mucosa as a stand-in for saliva, researchers observed how chocolate dissolves. Fat on the outer surface of the chocolate coated the tongues, leaving a fatty film on the silicone. Once dissolved, cocoa particles hit the tongue, offering further sensation. Fat inside the chocolate seemed to make less of a difference.', 'Why is that last detail important? It could be that chocolate with a lower fat content could still prove satisfying.

208,Why Do We Have Eyebrows?,"['evolution', 'the body', 'science', 'anthropology']","['Eyebrows are the Swiss Army knife of the human face. Scientists believe they remained, even after evolution caused humans to lose most of their body hair, because they serve a few key purposes.', 'First, they protect your eyes. The shape of the brow ridge and the outward-growing hairs of the brows themselves channel sweat, rain, and moisture away from the eyeballs, so your vision stays clear. They can also catch dust or shield eyes from sun glare.', 'Second, theyâ\x80\x99re essential for nonverbal communication. Scientists who study facial expressions say eyebrows are important for expressing happiness, surprise, and anger, a function that our human ancestors may have employed as well. ', 'In 2018, researchers tried to decipher why the brow ridges of Homo neanderthal and Homo erectus were much more prominent that ours, and hypothesized that it had to do with accommodating the force of their bite. But when they manipulated a 3D computer model of an ancient hominin, bite pressure didnâ\x80\x98t justify the big brows. The researchers surmised that social communication was the more likely reason. ', 'Over millennia, our brows have evolved to be smaller, more malleable, and useful for nonverbal communication. For example, todayâ\x80\x98s speakers of sign language contort their eyebrows to complement hand signs.', 'Third, eyebrows act as an ID card. Eyebrows stand out against the forehead, can be clearly seen from a distance, and donâ\x80\x99t change very much over timeâ\x80\x94making them perfect for identifying people. In a 2003 study at MIT [PDF], people were shown a picture of Richard Nixon with his eyes Photoshopped out, and then a picture with his eyebrows erased.

213,Why Do We Yawn?,"['big-questions', 'brain', 'science']","['Yawning seems to serve no purposeâ\x80\x94itâ\x80\x98s just a big exhalation of air when weâ\x80\x98re tired, bored, or next to someone else whoâ\x80\x98s yawning. So why do we yawn? The short answer is that no one really knows.  But there are few interesting theories.', 'The belief that we yawn to get rid of carbon dioxide and take in more oxygen persists despite research disproving it. According to this theory, people breathe more slowly when theyâ\x80\x98re bored or sleepy and less oxygen gets to the lungs. As CO2 builds up in the blood, the brain reflexively prompts a deep, oxygen-rich breath.', 'The problem with this theory is a 1987 study by the late Dr. Robert Provine, a professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, who was regarded as the worldâ\x80\x98s foremost yawn expert. Provine set up an experiment in which volunteers breathed one of four gases that contained varying ratios of carbon dioxide to oxygen for 30 minutes. Normal air contains 20.95 percent oxygen and 0.03 percent carbon dioxide, but neither of the gases in the experiment with higher concentrations of CO2 caused the research subjects to yawn more.', 'In 2007, two researchers at the University of Albany proposed that the purpose of yawning is to cool the brain. They conducted an experiment similar to Provineâ\x80\x98s and again found that raising or lowering oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood did not change the number or length of yawns.', 'Subsequent experiments focused on two well-established brain cooling mechanisms: nasal breathing and forehead cooling. When you breathe through your nose, it cools the blood vessels in the nasal cavity and sends that cooler blood to the brain. Likewise, when you cool your forehead, the veins there, some of which are directly connected to the brain, deliver cooler blood. The researchers found that their test subjects with warm or room temperature towels pressed against their heads yawned more than those with cold towels. Subjects who breathed through their noses during the experiment did not yawn at all.', 'The researchers said their evidence suggests that taking in a big gulp of air with a yawn cools the brain and maintains mental efficiency.', 'Reading about or even thinking about yawning can cause you to yawn. Almost all vertebrates yawn spontaneously, but only humans, chimps, and macaques yawn as a result of watching another individual do it. ', 'Given that these are social creatures that live in groups, the contagious yawn may have evolved as a way to coordinate behavior and maintain group vigilance. When one individual yawned, the group took that as evidence that their brain temperature was up and their mental efficiency was down. If all members of the group then yawned, the overall level of vigilance in the group was enhanced. In humans, who have developed other ways to signal how vigilant they should be, contagious yawns may remain as a vestigial response.', 'A version of this story ran in 2008; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20486/why-do-we-yawn

This not-so-subtle sci-fi sequence is actually based on something real: the Yellowstone supervolcano. What distinguishes this kind of volcano from regular volcanoes, and what will happen ifâ\x80\x94or whenâ\x80\x94it erupts?', 'There are four main types of volcanoes: Cinder cones, composite or stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, and lava domes, which all rise above the earth.  But supervolcanoes like the one under Yellowstone are calderas: vast sunken areas formed when the volcano expels all of its magma, and the land comes back to rest in the empty chamber. These calderas can be as big as 60 miles across (the current Yellowstone caldera, which sits on several older calderas, measures about 30 miles by 45 miles). ', 'When Mount St. Helens, a stratovolcano located in Washington, erupted in 1980, the event rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) and expelled one cubic kilometer of ash. But supervolcanoes register 8 on the VEI and typically expel 10,000 times that volume of magma and ash. The most recent Yellowstone eruption, which occurred 630,000 years ago, released 240 cubic miles of volcanic debris.', 'The Yellowstone supervolcano is just one of several scattered around the globe. An incomplete list includes Taupo in New Zealand, which last erupted in the 3rd century CE. Before that was a supereruption of Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia, which occurred 74,000 years ago. Thereâ\x80\x98s a supervolcano near Pompeii, and one in Chile, too. There may be more we havenâ\x80\x98t yet discovered.', 'Below Yellowstoneâ\x80\x98s surfaceâ\x80\x94in some places as little as 5 or 6 miles deepâ\x80\x94is a reservoir of solid rock and magma. Below that is a 45-mile-wide plume of molten rock that comes from at least 410 miles beneath the Earthâ\x80\x98s surface. This is what fuels Yellowstoneâ\x80\x98s incredible geysers and geothermal pools.  Bob Smith, who first described Yellowstone as â\x80\x9ca living, breathing calderaâ\x80\x9d in 1979, says in his book Windows into the Earth that if the caldera were to erupt, â\x80\x9cdevastation would be complete and incomprehensible.â\x80\x9d', 'First there would be swarms of earthquakes, then a huge blast that would wipe Yellowstone off the map. Clouds of ash and gas would burn everything in their paths. Ash would cover most of North America, destroying food sources. Some speculate that a supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera would instantly kill 87,000 people. Others say that such an eruption would lower the temperature of the Earth by at least 21 degrees, and might even block out the sun.', 'One study determined that if or when Yellowstone next erupts, it will probably be centered in one of three parallel fault zones running north-northwest across the national park.', 'Still, thereâ\x80\x98s probably no reason to worry. Chances are that a supereruption wonâ\x80\x98t occur in our lifetimes. Number crunchers have determined that only 1.4 supereruptions occur every million years, and, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the odds of Yellowstone erupting are slim: just one in 730,000, or 0.00014 percent, a year.', 'A version of this story ran in 2012; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/32008/what-supervolcano

The formation of large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas, is often at the center of these investigations. Some believe that the formation of these mountains causes increased weathering, which could then allow more carbon from the air to get stored in rocks [PDF].', 'Newer research complicates this pictureâ\x80\x94it may be that mountain formation doesnâ\x80\x99t lead to an increase in weathering overall, but instead exposes rocky material thatâ\x80\x99s more reactive, and therefore more efficient at weathering rocks and sequestering carbon. Anything that exposes new rocky material would therefore lead to increased carbon sequestration.', 'This is an area of intense interest for geologists and other climate scientists. At minimum, the slow carbon cycle could give us insights into how the planet regulates its temperature.

Theyâ\x80\x99re referring to the most recent glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary period. (An epoch is a timeframe within a period; a period is a longer timeframe within an era.)

The land bridge divides the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. When it formed, it drastically changed both oceansâ\x80\x99 currents, as the warm, tropical water could no longer flow between them. The warmer water went north, causing more precipitation in the Northern Hemisphereâ\x80\x99s high latitudes. This precipitationâ\x80\x94which, at high latitudes, fell as snowâ\x80\x94kept piling up and freezing to form glaciers and ice sheets.

218,15 Scientific Reasons Spring Is the Most Delightful Season,"['science', 'weather', 'lists']","['Summer, winter, and fall may have their fans, but spring is clearly the most lovable of the four seasons. Not convinced? Here are 15 scientific reasons why spring is great.', 'Spring marks the end of blistering winter and the transitional period to scorching summer. In many places, the season brings mild temperatures in the 60s and 70s Fahrenheit. People tend to be most comfortable at temperatures of about 72Â°F, so the arrival of spring means you can finally ditch the heavy winter layers and still be comfortable.', 'Following the spring equinox, days begin lasting longer and nights get shorter. Daylight saving time, which moves the clock forward starting in March, gives you even more light hours to get things done. Those extra hours of sun can be a major mood-booster, according to some research. A 2016 study of students in counseling at Brigham Young University found that the longer the sun was up during the day, the less mental distress people experienced.', 'Many animals migrate south during the winter, then head north as temperatures rise. For relatively northern regions, thereâ\x80\x99s no better indicator of spring than birds chirping outside your window. Their northward migration can start as early as mid-February and last into June, meaning that throughout the spring, you can expect to see a major avian influx. In addition to the satisfaction of marking species off your bird-watching checklist, seeing more of our feathered friends can make you happy. In 2017, a UK study found that the more birds people could see in their neighborhoods, the better their mental health.', 'Many animals reproduce in the spring, when temperatures are warmer and food is plentiful. Baby bunnies, ducklings, chipmunks, and other adorable animals abound come spring. Studies have found that seeing cute animals can have positive effects on humans. For instance, one small study in 2012 found that when college students looked at cute images of baby animals, they were better at focusing on a task in the lab. Being able to watch fluffy baby squirrels frolic outside your office window might make spring your most productive season of the year.', 'In 2015, a pair of public policy researchers discovered a hidden upside to â\x80\x9cspringing forwardâ\x80\x9d for daylight saving time. It reduced crime. When the sun set later in the evening, the study published in the Review of Economics and Statistics found, robbery rates fell. After daylight saving time started in the spring, there was a 27 percent drop in robberies during that extra hour of evening sunlight, and a 7 percent drop over the course of the whole day.', ""Warmer temperatures mean you can spend more time outdoors without freezing your feet off, which is great for mental health. Across the seasons, research has found that taking walks in nature slows your heart rate and makes you more relaxed, but some research indicates that there is something special about spring's effect on your brain. A 2005 study from the University of Michigan linked spending 30 minutes or more outside in warm, sunny spring weather to higher mood and better memory. But the effect reverses when spring ends, since being outside in the warmest days of summer is usually pretty uncomfortable."", 'That same University of Michigan study found that spending time outside in the sunny spring weather isnâ\x80\x99t just a mood booster; it actually can change the way people think. The researchers found that being outdoors broadened participantsâ\x80\x99 minds, leaving them more open to new information and creative thoughts.', 'Spring brings green growth back to plants and trees. Depending on where you live, trees may begin sporting new leaves as early as mid-March. That successful spring leaf growth ensures a cool canopy to relax under during the hot summerâ\x80\x94a hugely important factor in keeping cities comfortable. According to researchers, vegetation plays a big role in mitigating the urban heat island effect. When trees release water back into the air through evapotranspiration, it can cool down the areas around them by up to 9Â°F, according to the EPA.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s amazing what a little sun can do for plants and grass. Through photosynthesis, plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into food, releasing oxygen in the process. That means as plants start to grow in the spring, they pull carbon out of the atmosphere, providing an important environmental service. Plants take in roughly 25 percent of the carbon emissions humans produce, absorbing more than 100 gigatons of carbon through photosynthesis each growing season. Because of this, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere drops each spring and summer. (Unfortunately, it rises in the winter, when most plants arenâ\x80\x99t growing.)', 'Many vegetables and some fruits are harvested in the spring. â\x80\x98Tis the season to get your local asparagus, peas, rhubarb, and other fresh produce. Getting more fruits and vegetables into your diet isnâ\x80\x99t just good for the body; itâ\x80\x99s good for the soul. A 2016 study of more than 12,000 Australians found that when people increased the amount of fruits and vegetables in their diet, they felt happier and had higher rates of life satisfaction. If they increased their intake by eight portions a day (a tall order, we know) the psychological gains were equivalent to the change in well-being people experience when they go from being unemployed to having a job, the researchers found.', 'After months spent conserving energy, flowers bloom in the spring, once they sense that the days have grown longer and the weather has turned warmer. Thatâ\x80\x99s good for humans, because several studies have shown that looking at flowers can make you happy.  A 2005 study from Rutgers University found that when participants were presented with a bouquet of flowers, it resulted in what scientists call a â\x80\x9ctrue smileâ\x80\x9d a full 100 percent of the time. Seeing flowers had both â\x80\x9cimmediate and long-term effectsâ\x80\x9d that resulted in elevated moods for days afterward, according to the researchers [PDF].', 'While itâ\x80\x99s important to keep moving no matter what the weather is, research shows that working out can be more beneficial if you do it outside. A 2011 study found that, compared with an indoor workout, exercising outdoors in nature increased energy levels, made people feel revitalized, and decreased tension, among other positive effects. People who worked out in the fresh air also tended to say they enjoyed the experience more and would be likely to repeat it, suggesting that using nature as your gym might help you stick with your exercise regimen. While those benefits probably extend to winter, too, itâ\x80\x99s a whole lot easier to stomach the idea of a run once the weather warms up.', 'Flu season in the U.S. typically lasts through the fall and winter, usually peaking between December and February and tapering off during the spring. The seasonal change is in part because of dry air. Cold temperatures mean a drop in humidity, and indoor heating only makes the air drier. This lack of moisture in the air can dry out your skin and the nasal cavities, leading to nose bleeds, irritated sinuses, and a greater risk of getting sick. Since the mucus in your nose is designed to trap viruses, when it dries up, youâ\x80\x99re more likely to catch something nasty, like the flu. As the weather warms up and becomes more humid throughout the spring, that mucus comes back. As the season wears on, not only can you lay off the body lotion, but you can probably put away the tissuesâ\x80\x94if you donâ\x80\x99t have spring allergies, that is.', 'Temperate weather makes it easier to get the fresh air you need. Opening your windows and allowing the breeze in serves as an important way to ventilate indoor spaces, according to the EPA. A lack of ventilation can lead to an unhealthy concentration of indoor pollutants from sources like cleaning product fumes, certain furniture and building materials, and stoves (especially gas ones), not to mention the COVID-19 virus. All of these factors pose a threat to your health and comfort. Winter brings the highest rates of indoor pollutants like nitrogen oxide, a 2016 study of unventilated stove use in homes found. Spring brings the perfect opportunity to throw open those windows and doors and get the air moving again.', 'Sunlight triggers your body to produce vitamin D, which keeps your bones strong. At northern latitudes, itâ\x80\x99s harder to get enough sun exposure naturally to maintain healthy vitamin D levels during the winterâ\x80\x94even if you did want to expose your skin to the elementsâ\x80\x94but that starts to change during the spring. One study found that in Valencia, Spain (which shares a latitude with Philadelphia, Denver, Baltimore, Kansas City, and several other major U.S. cities), people only need 10 minutes outside with a quarter of their bodies exposed to the spring sunshine to get an adequate daily dose of vitamin D.', 'A version of this story originally ran in 2014; it has been updated for 2023.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/55573/15-scientific-reasons-spring-most-delightful-season

Rather than taking home single-use plastics and sending them to a landfill every time they buy food, they rely on a handful of totes that last them for years. This practice sounds better for the environment in theory, but the sustainability of reusable bags versus plastic ones is more complicated than you might assume.', 'Like plastic grocery bags, reusable bags require fossils fuels to manufacture. As CNN reports, the carbon footprint of reusable totes actually outsizes their disposable counterparts many times over. In fact, according to an estimate from Denmarkâ\x80\x99s Environmental Protection Agency [PDF], a cotton bag needs to be used at least 7100 times to offset the environmental impact of its production. Even if you took your bags to the store every day, it would still take you nearly two decades to reach that mark. Reusable bags made from durable plastic materials like nonwoven polypropylene have a smaller carbon footprint, and only need to be used around 37 times before the purchase pays off.

Humpbacks sometimes copy each otherâ\x80\x99s songs and even pass songs from one generation to the next.', 'But noise generated by human activities is increasingly interfering with residents of the underwater world. Scientists have observed migrating humpbacks avoiding noisy areas, making detours that could cost them valuable time and energy. Loud noise also may increase mass strandings of whales and dolphins. Researchers recorded only five of these events from 1900 to 1950, the year naval operations began using super loud, high-power sonar. From 1950 to 2004, they logged more than 1200 mass strandings.', 'Now, some companies are employing tiny bubbles to stifle ocean noise and protect these marine giants. The technology creates curtains of shimmering air bubbles rising through the water. While individual bubbles are fragile things, walls of them can muffle a major source of loud underwater noise: pile driving.', 'Piles are supports for bridges, wind turbines, oil and gas platforms, and other large marine structures. Theyâ\x80\x99re driven deep into the seafloor using hydraulic hammers that repeatedly and rapidly strike their tops. It makes a lot of noise. Depending on the pile diameter, hammer size, bottom properties, and the depth needed, driving in a single pile can take several hours and as many as 5000 strikes.', 'Bubble curtains are formed by forcing air through closely spaced openings in tubes placed in a ring around a stationary source of noise such as pile driving. Air and water have different densities and transmit sound differently, so the bubbles absorb some of the sound energy and some sound bounces off them, essentially becoming trapped inside the curtain.', 'Quantifying how much difference a bubble curtain makes is tricky, given variables such as turbulence, water depth, and temperature; the structure of the curtain (including size and force of the air); and the complexity of sound itself. Sound moves in waves that, when they pass our ears (and those of whales), cause a change in pressure, known as amplitude. Increasing amplitude makes a sound louder and increases its intensity, expressed in decibels (dB). Each dB level increase of 10 represents multiplying the intensity by 10.', 'For example, a 10 dB sound is 10 times more intense than a 0 dB one, a 20 dB sound is 100 times more intense, and a 30 dB sound 1000 times more intense. While dB levels in water are not the same as those in air, the general principles are similar.', 'Scientists have measured reductions of up to 30 dB from bubble curtains used around pile driving for a bridge in California [PDF]. German company Hydrotechnik LÃ¼beck claims that its Big Bubble Curtain, currently in wide use in the North and Baltic Seas, can reduce the volume of pile driving noise by up to 95 percent.', 'Tobias Bohne, a researcher with the Institute of Structural Analysis at Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany, has studied the effect of bubble curtains on pile driving noise. He tells Mental Floss that an advantage of bubble curtains is that they can be placed far enough from the source to be combined with other systems designed to reduce noise, such as cofferdams (insulating sleeves around the pile) and dampeners on the hammers. One study showed that a combination of a bubble curtain and a cofferdam reduced noise levels more than 10dBâ\x80\x94a 10-fold decrease [PDF].', 'Other tweaks to pile driving operations can help as well.

Also, what counts for just plain water?', 'Hardness is defined by the minerals the water contains as a result of how itâ\x80\x99s sourced. Groundwater sourced near porous rocks, for example, will contain more minerals, while water from glaciers has almost none. If your water picks up calcium and magnesium in large amounts en route to your tap, itâ\x80\x99s considered hard water. Health departments often assess hardness by measuring the milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anything below 60 mg/L is soft, up to 120 mg/L is moderately hard, 121 to 180 is is the hard stuff. Over 180 is considered very hard.', 'Is it harmful? No, but it can have annoying effects. Hard water is safe to drink and may even be beneficial to someone who is mineral-deficient.

It can also make washing soap off your hands harder, since the minerals reduce lather and increase soap scum.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s not just your hair and skin: Hard water can also lead to scale build-up in plumbing. And it can create the mineral spots you see after washing glassware. In general, itâ\x80\x99s not ideal. ', 'Soft water, on the other hand, is mostly free of these minerals, making it far less likely to be a problem for your skin, plumbing, or surfaces.

224,Why Do We Gasp When We're Surprised or Alarmed?,"['brain', 'evolution', 'science']","['If you get caught off-guard by a sudden bang, or an unexpected tap on the shoulder, or the sight of a spider high-tailing it across the floor of your shower, thereâ\x80\x99s a good chance that youâ\x80\x99ll let out an audible gasp. That sharp intake of breath is often an involuntary reaction to surprise and alarm. But why do we do it?', 'Gasping is tied to an innate survival mechanism, hardwired into humans through evolution: the fight-or-flight response. When faced with a potential threat, our bodies start preparing to react, either by engaging with the danger or getting away as quickly as possible. Within an instant, a complex chain of biological events takes placeâ\x80\x94and a small, almond-shaped region of the brain called the amygdala is responsible for ringing the first alarm bell.Â\xa0', 'When we hear or see something threatening, the amygdala sends distress signals to the hypothalamus, known as the brainâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9ccommand centerâ\x80\x9d because it helps regulate important bodily functions. The hypothalamus triggers the sympathetic nervous system, which is the driving force in our reaction to danger or stress.Â\xa0', 'Once the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the adrenal glands start pumping hormones, including adrenaline, into the bloodstream. Driven by this surge in adrenaline, the body undergoes numerous changes designed to help us think or act quickly. Our pupils dilate to let in more light and allow us to see better. We breathe more quickly so we can take in as much oxygen as possible. Our hearts start racing, pushing oxygen to major muscle groups and other organs that might need to kick into high gear to deal with a possible threat.Â\xa0', 'Gasping in shockâ\x80\x94an emotion that is closely linked to fearâ\x80\x94may similarly prepare us for go time. The physiologic changes that are triggered by the fight-or-flight response cause the body to use oxygen more quickly, according to BBC Science Focus Magazine; a deep inhale may provide an extra jolt of oxygen in these moments of heightened stress.', 'Since the days of our ancient ancestors, humansâ\x80\x99 fight-or-flight response has helped us survive dangerous situations. But it can get triggered by things that donâ\x80\x99t pose any real threat. So after that initial gasp of surprise, take a deep breath and try to make peace with the creepy crawly invading your spaceâ\x80\x94itâ\x80\x99s probably pretty keen to get away from you, too.

Yet that appears to be the fate of some tree frogs, according to new research.', 'A paper recently published in the journal Current Biology demonstrates that certain species of male wasps come equipped with a pokey apparatus on their genitals meant to mimic stinging ability, which only females have due to their ovipositors, or egg-laying organs. When a larger animalâ\x80\x94like a frogâ\x80\x94attempts to ingest the male wasp, the prey can surprise the predator with a non-venomous jab. The defensive strategy may prompt the frog to spit out the wasp unharmed.', 'Researchers at Kobe University in Japan put male mason wasps (Anterhynchium gibbifronsin) in a container with tree frogs, forcing a confrontation. All 17 frogs tried to eat their prey, and two-thirds of them were successful. One third of the wasps, however, eluded their fate with their spikes. Wasps that had their genitals removed, however, were eaten 100 percent of the time.', 'You can see the David Cronenberg-esque scene below:', 'While the genital stabbers boost the waspsâ\x80\x99 odds of survival, itâ\x80\x99s not quite the same as having the venom to back it up: Female wasps managed to escape roughly 87 percent of the time.', 'The study suggests that the male wasps are able to emulate an anti-predator defense somewhat successfully. â\x80\x9cOf course he canâ\x80\x99t sting, but heâ\x80\x99s trying to fake you out,â\x80\x9d sting expert Dr. Justin O.

Itâ\x80\x99s a rare diagnosisâ\x80\x94only about one or two out of every 1 million people have it.', 'For many individuals, this was the first time hearing that SPS even exists. Hereâ\x80\x99s what you need to know about the rare condition.', 'SPS is a neurological autoimmune disorder. People who have it get severe muscle spasms and stiff muscles in the torso, arms, and legs. For Dion, SPS is even affecting her vocal cords, which makes her unable to sing. The disorder can also lead to increased sensitivity to sound, stress, and physical contact. Sometimes, that increased sensitivity can trigger the spasms. It can get so bad that people with it can have trouble walking or become disabled.', ""Because SPS is such a rare disorder, doctors and scientists donâ\x80\x99t know exactly what causes it. But according to Yale Medicine, researchers are getting close. One theory is that it's an autoimmune reaction attacking the bodyâ\x80\x99s glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) protein. GAD helps make gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which regulates motor neurons in the brain. If thereâ\x80\x99s less GABA, the neurons overreact, leading to the spasms."", 'SPS is twice as common in women than it is in men, and symptoms usually start to show between ages 30 and 60. Itâ\x80\x99s often diagnosed in conjunction with another autoimmune disorder, like type 1 diabetes, and is more common in patients with cancer.', 'Unfortunately, SPS does not have a cure. But it is treatable with medication, immunotherapies, and some types of physical therapy. The anti-anxiety drug diazepam, an anticonvulsant medication called gabapentin, and the muscle relaxer baclofen can be used to ease the spasms and stiffness that accompany SPS, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Now, researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have managed to demonstrate just what kind of aerosolized feces weâ\x80\x99re dealing with.', 'According to Smithsonian, the team struck upon the idea of aiming green lasers at a toilet, dimming the lights, and letting cameras capture the now-illuminated particles ejected during flushing when they scattered the laser light.

229,12 Facts About Chernobylâs Exclusion Zone,"['history', 'science', 'health', 'lists']","['On April 26, 1986, disaster struck reactor number four at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. At first, Soviet officials attempted to hide the cataclysmic events unfolding in Ukraine, but when radioactive clouds were detected as far away as Sweden, news spread that the unthinkable had happened: a lethal explosion at a nuclear facility.', 'Residents at the neighboring town of Pripyat werenâ\x80\x99t told of the deadly radiation covering their homes at first. As official buses began evacuating the area, people were instructed to bring only a suitcase, since they would be able to return in a few days. But as the extent of the explosion became clear, the Soviet military established an official Exclusion Zone, a roughly 18-mile radius around the stricken power plant. About 115,000 people were evacuated in 1986, and another 220,000 in the following years, leaving a desolate landscape of abandoned towns and villages.', 'More than 30 years after the disaster, much of the Exclusion Zoneâ\x80\x94now encompassing 1000 miles and also called the Zone of Alienationâ\x80\x94is still strictly off-limits. The area remains a chilling reminder of nuclear disaster, while at the same time drawing thousands of tourists each year and demonstrating the resilience of nature.', 'The Hotel Desyatka, located within the 30-kilometer exclusion zone, is simple but safe. Wi-Fi gives explorers the unique experience of being able to email friends and relatives from deep inside the zone. The hotel is the only place for intrepid explorers to the zone to stay, but its staff are only allowed to work on a strict rotation of 15 days in the zone and 15 outside, to keep their radiation exposure to a minimum. Workers inside the zone live in basic dormitories in the town of Chernobyl.', 'Tourists are required to travel with a guide. There are strict military-style checkpoints at the 30-kilometer zone border, at the 10-kilometer border, and at the entrance to the ghostly town of Pripyat. Your name and passport must be submitted to authorities seven to 10 days in advance, and the guards check you and your passport numbers at each checkpoint. The early days of the zoneâ\x80\x98s establishment saw a large problem with local intruders infiltrating the vast perimeter to ransack Pripyat and other areas, but since 2007, the Ukrainian government has clamped down on trespassing.', 'Chernobyl was the largest town in whatâ\x80\x99s now the exclusion zone. Dating back to the 12th century, it was once a vibrant community with a large Jewish population. Many of the residents were murdered by the Red Army and then during the Nazi occupation in the first half of the 20th century. At the time of the disaster, the population had increased, largely due to the nuclear industry, to approximately 14,000.', 'Today, Pripyat attracts most of the attention. Opened in 1970, Pripyat was designed as a model communist city filled with young workers; the average age of the roughly 50,000 inhabitants was about 26. The now-empty town had a disco, gymnasium, movie theater, sports field, and the famous amusement park. One of the most-frequented parts of Pripyat, according to tour guides, was the maternity ward. About 1000 babies were born in Pripyat each year.', 'As roads have steadily deteriorated, the smaller towns deep in the Exclusion Zone have become cut off and remain mostly unvisited. Across the border in Belarus, the effects of the explosion were similarly catastrophic, if not more so. An estimated 70 percent of the fallout descended on Belarus, contaminating approximately a quarter of the country. The most heavily hit areas in Belarus are now part of the 834-square mile Polesie State Radiation Ecological Reserve, a mixture of forests and deserted industrialized areas.', 'Roughly 2400 people still work at the decommissioned plant: mostly security guards, firemen protecting the volatile area from deadly forest fires, and service staff for the workers. Like the hotel staff, they live in the zone on a rotation pattern of 15 days in, 15 days out, to keep their radiation exposure manageable.', 'About 200 older residents also live full-time in the zone, having returned to their ancestral villages despite warnings from the Ukrainian government.', 'Aside from the hotel, there is one bar, a post office that still makes one daily noon collection, and a supermarket, where produce is scarce but with the shelves are filled with alcohol. There is even a museum and something virtually non-existent in post-1991 Ukraine: a statue of Lenin. Because it remains mostly frozen at the moment of the 1986 evacuation, Chernobyl is one of the few places where the Soviet hammer and sickle can still be seen.', 'The Exclusion Zone began allowing officially sanctioned visits, mostly for scientists and reporters, almost as soon as it was created. In recent years, tour groups have begun organizing brief, strictly controlled visits. One tour guide, named Nikolai, told Mental Floss in 2016 that a couple got engaged on one of his tours. Before the proposal, the groom-to-be asked Nikolai if he could take them to the most contaminated area possible for the big moment.', 'Inside Chernobyl, there is a strict curfew of 8 p.m. At night in the town square, one of the only things you can hear aside from the stray dogs barking is a strange sequence of rising electronic beeps coming from the forest somewhere to the north, which sounds a bit like the famous five-note sequence in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A tour guide told Mental Floss that they come from the scientistsâ\x80\x98 camp, which is constantly monitoring radiation levels.', 'Every visitor coming out of the Exclusion Zone goes through a radiation screening at each checkpoint. If your levels are too high, clothes and boots are either washed or left behind. Taking anything out of Chernobyl is forbidden. Tour guides like Nikolai are checked regularly, and say they donâ\x80\x99t receive anywhere near the annual levels of radiation deemed too dangerous.', 'Despite the growing numbers of tourists, the zone is still highly toxic and dangerous. The landscape is dotted with warning signs indicating where the â\x80\x9chot spotsâ\x80\x9d are. Walking around is for the most part safe, but the greatest danger comes from ingesting radioactive particles. Nikolai has had to warn visitors against posing for photographs licking trees, eating berries, and rolling around in the earth. Parts of the zone, particularly near reactor four and in the basements of buildings such as Pripyatâ\x80\x99s hospital, remain dangerously high.', 'One of the most remarkable parts of the Exclusion Zone is southeast of the reactors: the eerie Duga-3 radar station. Once one of the most secretive spots in the Soviet Union, this vast construction of antennae and aerials was pointed in the direction of the United States, listening for incoming planes and missiles. On maps, it was marked as a childrenâ\x80\x98s summer camp, while the locals were told it was a radio tower. Around 1500 high-grade technicians, scientists, and military personnel worked and lived here, wrapped in the highest levels of Cold War secrecy. There was even a kindergarten. Today, there is just one soldier guarding the peculiar complex, the propaganda murals on the walls decayed and long-forgotten.', 'The zone will continue to be contaminated by the radiation from the disaster for about 300 years.

The flashes last from a few seconds to several minutes. On average, women going through menopause will experience regular hot flashes for about four yearsâ\x80\x94but a very unlucky third of women have to deal with them for about a decade. And for Black and Indigenous American women, itâ\x80\x99s even worse.

They knew that it was related to a malfunctioning hypothalamus, but didnâ\x80\x99t know exactly where the problem came from. A 2018 study in the journal Neuroendocrinology, though, shows that scientists were finally able to trace it back to specific neurons in the hypothalamus, called KNDy (pronounced candy) neurons. KNDy neurons regulate temperature, and the new drug blocks those neurons when they start to improperly react, which causes a hot flash.', 'â\x80\x9cWhen estrogen falls, it causes this KNDy neuron complex to just basically go bonkers,â\x80\x9d Dr. Susan Reed said during a keynote speech at the 2020 Annual North American Menopause Society Conference, as reported by UW Medicine. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s like turning on a gazillion fire hydrants, which spill over into the adjacent thermoregulatory center and cause thermoregulatory dysregulation, resulting in hot flashes.

Here are a few you might not be aware of, adapted from an episode of The List Show on YouTube.', 'Back in the 1970s, NASAâ\x80\x99s Apollo astronauts were busy taking samples of the moonâ\x80\x99s crust to send back to Earth. They didnâ\x80\x99t have a problem scooping up dust from the surface, but to get a better picture of the lunar soil, they needed to design a new drill to retrieve core samples. The new machine had to be small and lightweight to fit on the lunar lander, and it had to have its own power source.', 'NASA hired Black & Decker to create the tool [PDF], and the company developed a computer program to optimize the drillâ\x80\x99s design. It ended up being so successful that the company continued using the program in new consumer products. In 1979, they released the Dustbusterâ\x80\x94a cordless, lightweight, hand-held vacuum built on the same principles as the moon drill. It weighed only two pounds and recharged its batteries in its own charging bracket.

In the 1960s, NASA began developing space food for its astronauts. The food had to be nutritious, but also lightweight, shelf-stable, and easy to eat in spaceâ\x80\x94meaning no crumbs that could fly around in zero Gs and clog delicate equipment. They started off with food in what were essentially toothpaste tubes, but eventually went to the Army Natick Laboratories, which had been working on freeze-dried meals for the military. The lab had developed a product that required boiling water and waiting 20 minutes for the food to become edible. NASA needed a product that could be reconstituted in 10 minutes with room temperature water. And under NASAâ\x80\x99s funding and direction, that became a reality.', 'While the food lab continued to experiment with different freeze-dried items for astronauts, NASA licensed the technology to other government agencies. In the mid-1970s, Texas organizations launched a program to provide nutritious freeze-dried meals based on NASAâ\x80\x99s tech for elderly residents [PDF], and in New York, a company called Sky-Lab Foods developed NASA-style freeze-dried meals for seniors and homebound individuals [PDF].', 'Possibly the most famous astronaut food of all time, freeze-dried ice cream, may or may not have ever made it to space.

When its spacecraft windows fogged up before launches, NASA developed a fogless coating for the glass that was later licensed to more than 60 companies. Made of liquid detergent, deionized water, and fire-resistant oil, the solution is used to keep scuba masks, ski goggles, car windows, fireproof helmets, and eyeglasses fog-free [PDF].', 'Speaking of glasses, NASA also helped create scratch-resistant lenses. When the FDA mandated in 1972 that all eyeglasses had to be shatter-resistant, manufacturers replaced glass lenses with plastic. The downside was that plastic got scratched easily.', 'In a completely unrelated series of events, NASA scientist Theodore J. Wydeven, Jr. was working to improve water purification systems on spacecraft and developed a way to apply a specific kind of thin plastic coating. NASA realized this innovation had other applications, including making scratch-resistant coatings for space helmet visors. With the help of sunglasses company Foster Grant, the technology was soon applied to plastic lenses, to the tune of 5 million pairs of sunglasses in just three years. Today, anti-scratch coating is included in almost all eyeglass and prescription sunglass purchases.', 'For the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, the crew landed on the moon to explore sites of interest. To make their work easier, NASA designed a portable workbench on wheels dubbed the Modularized Equipment Transporter, or MET. Astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell, who dragged it across the lunar landscape, called it the Rickshaw. The Rickshawâ\x80\x99s tires were engineered by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for the Johnson Space Center to withstand the harsh lunar environment. They remained rubbery at minus 195Â°F.', 'Here on Earth, at the time, summer tires would go stiff and lose traction in winter. Studded winter tires were one attempt to solve that problem, but they introduced their own issues, like chewing up road surfaces. Once the special moon tires had been developed, Goodyear and other manufacturers began offering winter tires that were formulated to stay pliable at cold temperatures. And the Goodyear tires included another NASA innovation: Their cords, which give stability to the tireâ\x80\x99s shape, were made of the same super-strong material as in the parachute lines of NASAâ\x80\x99s Viking Lander, which touched down on Mars in 1976.', 'NASA was the driving force behind developing a shock-absorbing foam in the mid-1960s to make airline passengers safer. After creating seat cushions with this foam, engineers realized it would not only protect passengers in case of a crash, but also be more comfortable on long flights because it distributed the sitterâ\x80\x99s weight evenly. It was called â\x80\x9cslow spring back foam,â\x80\x9d but when a NASA-affiliated company began licensing the product to other manufacturers, it was renamed Temper Foam.', 'NASA calls Temper Foam its â\x80\x9cmost recognized and widely usedâ\x80\x9d spinoff. Temper Foam has been used in Little League baseball helmets, the Dallas Cowboysâ\x80\x99 football helmets [PDF], and in other sports equipment to protect athletes [PDF]. The foam gives support to hospital beds for patients, and cushions prosthetic limbs for people and thoroughbred horses. Itâ\x80\x99s also used in motorcycle and helicopter seats.Â\xa0', 'One of Temper Foamâ\x80\x99s benefits is that it can match the contour of the object pressing against it and then return to its previous shape once the object is removedâ\x80\x94almost like it has â\x80¦ memory. As you might have guessed, Temper Foam, a.k.a. memory foam, is the key component of Tempur-pedic mattresses and dozens of other bedding products.', 'Another NASA invention we see regularly is aluminized mylar. This super-lightweight, silvery sheet is shiny on one side to reflect heat. When it faces inward it keeps heat in. Satellites were dressed up in mylar to reflect solar radiation [PDF]; mylar also insulated spacesuits. It was eventually licensed to sports outfitters to make lightweight, heat-conserving â\x80\x9cspace blankets,â\x80\x9d jackets, ski parkas, and emergency equipment. Marathoners often wrap themselves in mylar sheets after they complete a race, presumably to stay warm and/or let everyone know they just ran over 26 miles. You might also see the material in mylar balloons, which stay inflated a lot longer than latex balloons because the mylar is far less porous than latex.', 'Aluminized polymer sheets were also a crucial part of the Apollo missions. They insulated the command modulesâ\x80\x94and the astronauts insideâ\x80\x94from solar radiation and space temperatures that could swing between 400Â° and -400Â° Fahrenheit. The shiny film was so efficient at reflecting radiation that companies began using it as insulation in homes and commercial buildings. The Quantum International Corporation developed its Radiant Barrier products using NASAâ\x80\x99s mylar sheeting to both reflect solar radiation and keep interior temperatures either warm or coldâ\x80\x94kind of like how a Thermos can keep coffee hot or water cold for hours [PDF]. The Radiant Barrier technology has been adapted for use in commercial refrigerated trucks and passenger vehicles, too.', 'NASA added its tech to an early laptop in the mid-1980s. On a Space Shuttle mission in 1983, NASA astronauts first used the Shuttle Portable Onboard Computer, or SPOC. This small navigation monitoring computer was adapted from a commercial machine called the GriD Compass, which featured a flat screen, full-sized keyboard, and clamshell-style hinged construction.Â\xa0', 'NASA modified the design, incorporating components that would eventually end up in consumer laptops, such as fan-based cooling. They also added some flourishes that didnâ\x80\x99t find much use on computers here on Earth, like Velcro strips on the bottom to keep it from floating away [PDF]. Based on its partnership with NASA, the GRiD Compass became popular with other government agencies and the military, as well as energy and telecommunications companies.', 'Our final NASA invention is one that a lot of us use everyday: the camera in your smartphone. It started with the complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor, or CMOS, which NASA had developed to capture high-quality images on spacecraft. A NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer named Eric Fossum, who had refined the CMOSâ\x80\x99s capabilities over several years, licensed the invention and began to partner with companies like Kodak and Intel to create custom sensors. ', 'The sensors found a home in DSLR cameras and in the GoProâ\x80\x94where a lightweight high-def video camera could shineâ\x80\x94but it took mobile phones to really make the technology ubiquitous. Its small size and low power requirements made it a perfect fit for cell phones. By 2013, more than a billion CMOS image sensors had been produced, with many ending up inside smartphones. Itâ\x80\x99s probably not too much of an exaggeration to say that this NASA innovation helped launch the careers of thousands of Instagram influencers.', 'As the legend goes, NASA realized that normal pens wouldnâ\x80\x99t write in the microgravity environment of space, so it spent zillions of dollars trying to invent a pen that did. The Soviet space program, meanwhile, gave their cosmonauts pencils, supposedly illustrating what happens when common sense takes a backseat to bureaucracy. ', 'In reality, the Fisher Pen Company invented the pen that writes upside down in 1965, and it addressed a real need; compared to pencils, pens pose less risk of breaking or sending stray graphite dust near critical components aboard a space shuttle.

232,What Makes Swear Words So $#%+@&! Offensive?

The right expletives, unleashed at the right moment, can be used to cause hurt or offense. They facilitate the expression of intense emotions. They may even help us better tolerate pain, as anyone who has yelped a curse word after stubbing a toe knows.', 'But why are certain words considered so profane that we feel the need to bleep them on TV and scold our kids for using them? According to a colorful new study in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, which analyzed swear words across multiple languages, the way curse words soundâ\x80\x94or donâ\x80\x99t soundâ\x80\x94may make them offensive to the human ear.', 'At the heart of the study is a fundamental question in the field of linguistics: Is language arbitrary? An established convention holds that yes, the relationship between the sound of words and their meanings is typically random. But some experts have challenged this notion, positing that certain sounds are â\x80\x9cintrinsically associated with certain meanings,â\x80\x9d write study authors Shiri Lev-Ari and Ryan McKay from Royal Holloway, University of London. Across many languages, for example, the word for nose is likely to include the nasal sound â\x80\x9cn.â\x80\x9dÂ\xa0', 'Research has also shown that English swear words have a higher proportion ofÂ\xa0p, t, and k sounds, which are known as plosives. But, Lev-Ari and McKay wondered, is this just a quirk of English?', 'Searching for patterns among the worldâ\x80\x99s naughtiest words, the researchers asked fluent speakers of five unrelated languagesâ\x80\x94Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Korean, and Russianâ\x80\x94to list at least five of the most vulgar words in their language, excluding racial slurs. The studyâ\x80\x99s authors did not find a higher incidence of plosives in these expletives. But they did observe that the words in their data set were less likely to include approximantsâ\x80\x94sounds that include l, r, w and yâ\x80\x94than might be expected by chance. Words containing these sounds, the authors theorize, may be less â\x80\x9csuitableâ\x80\x9d for causing offense.', 'The researchers next recruited 215 people to listen to pairs of words in an unfamiliar language and indicate which one was the swear word. Unbeknownst to the participants, all the word pairs were imaginary, created by the study authors to include one word with an approximant and one without. Participants were more likely to guess that the words without approximants were profanity.', 'In the final phase of their study, the researchers looked at minced oathsâ\x80\x94variations of English swear words that are considered less offensive, like â\x80\x9cdarnâ\x80\x9d as an alternative to â\x80\x9cdamn.â\x80\x9d Approximants appeared more frequently in minced oaths than in the swear words themselves, suggesting once again that l, r, w and y donâ\x80\x99t have the prickly effect of other sounds', 'â\x80\x9cIt may be that approximants are sound-symbolically associated with calm and contentment,â\x80\x9d Lev-Ari and McKay write, â\x80\x9cand so are unsuitable for giving offense.â\x80\x9d In any case, the researchers conclude, the absence of approximants in expletives suggests there is a universal pattern to swearingâ\x80\x94and when it comes to words that would make your grandma blush, sounds like l, r, w and y just donâ\x80\x99t pack the right damn punch.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/why-swear-words-sound-offensive
233,8 Unusual Shark Behaviors That Might Surprise You,"['Sharks', 'animals', 'animal behavior']","['Sharks have existed on Earth for over 400 million years. They live in every ocean on the planet, and in some rivers, and are essential to a balanced ocean ecosystemâ\x80\x94sharks keep the food chain in check and encourage species diversity. Sharks even help preserve carbon-capturing sea meadows by preying on the sea turtles that eat seagrasses.', 'Some shark behaviors may look a little odd to us, but there are good reasons why they have evolved to perform them. Here are eight of the most unusual acts and how they help sharks thrive.', 'Not every shark breeds in the same way; some lay eggs and others give birth to live young. The live-bearers, including great white, mako, tiger, and bull sharks, have an advantage over their egg-laying cousins: They begin to hone their hunting skills even before theyâ\x80\x99re born.', 'A female sand tiger shark has two uteruses and will produce multiple eggs. Research has shown that around 10 will be fertilized, while the rest serve as food for their stronger siblings. The growing embryos will begin hunting when they reach lengths of about 2 inches, using the unfertilized eggs as a means of subsistence. After that, they turn on their smaller and weaker siblings. This form of intrauterine cannibalism is known as embryophagy. Baby sharks will swim from one uterus to another in search of their prey until only the strongest two are born.', 'Embryophagy gives the pups several advantages. It sustains them over their nine to 12 months in the womb, making them bigger and healthier at birth, which gives them a better chance at survival.', 'It also clears the gene pool of the weaker sharks. The female sand tiger shark mates with several males, so her embryos have multiple fathers, but research has shown that in 60 percent of the litters the two pups came from the same father. The weaker fathersâ\x80\x98 genes go no further, while the two pups that are eventually born carry the stronger fathersâ\x80\x98 genes into the world. It also means that the baby sharks enter the world as a fully-fledged hunters.', 'Many sharks engage in cannibalism, especially when one of them is injured. A 2016 study found that the extinct Orthocanthus, which lived 300 million years ago, ate their own young when other resources ran out. Todayâ\x80\x99s lemon sharks seem to choose the tangled roots of shallow mangrove forests as a nursery, not only to protect their young from larger predators, but also from other lemon sharks.', 'Cannibalism is an unusual behavior for an animal that wants to survive, but itâ\x80\x99s a fundamental way to preserve their species. Not only is it a means to a meal, but it also allows the survival of the fittest individuals. Good thing sharks arenâ\x80\x99t sentimental.', 'Pre-birth survival is no easier for those sharks born from eggsâ\x80\x94and some species have developed ways of protecting themselves even before they are born, as a 2013 study of bamboo sharks found.', 'Egg-bearing sharks deposit their offspring in casings (sometimes called mermaidâ\x80\x99s purses) that attach themselves to plants by long tendrils. These pouches allow the embryos to hide their movements and scent as they grow. In the final stages of the gestation period, the cases open just enough to introduce the embryos to the salt waters of the ocean. At the same time, the baby sharksâ\x80\x99 electrosensory systems reach maturity and the animals begin to sense the world around them, which may include the electronic signals of their predators. Juvenile bamboo sharks are pre-programmed to read these signals and take actionâ\x80\x94namely, to hold their breath, screw themselves into balls, and freeze to avoid detection.', 'The studyâ\x80\x99s authors hint that this behavior could be used to develop electronic shark-repelling devices. Fishing nets accidentally kill millions of sharks (and other marine animals) every year, so equipping the nets with such devices might protect not just bamboo sharks, but all elasmobranchs.', 'Spy-hopping, a practice in which a sea creature raises its head out of the water, is most often associated with whales. While itâ\x80\x99s rare in sharks, a few species are known to pop their head out of the water and take a look around.', 'Some sharks will lift their head vertically above the water, while others swim along the surface with just an eye clear of it. In both cases, spy-hopping is about gathering information, perhaps for the location of prey, but the action itself is non-aggressive. A shark comes up to the surface gently, and may do it several times without ever lashing out.', 'Great white sharks are masters of spy-hopping, particularly around boats that are using chum to entice them closer. Research on oceanic whitetip sharks concluded that the fish can use their renowned sense of smell above the waterline to detect food at a distance. Itâ\x80\x99s also possible that the sharks are just curious.Â\xa0', 'Breaching is another behavior that might seem illogical for an animal that needs water to survive, but several species, like great white, basking, and bull sharks, do leap out of the water at high speeds. It can be a spectacular sight, with some sharks able to completely clear the water for several seconds due to the power they generate as they swim. The record is held by a great white, affectionately known as Rocket, who jumped 15 feet above the sea.', 'Breaching usually derives from hunting. Capturing an agile seal is no easy task, and sharks have learned that they need to ambush their prey if they want to be successful. Using the darker waters below as cover, a great white is able to sneak up on a seal, launch itself upwards at burst speeds of around 36 feet per second, and reach the seal before it can escape. The breach is an explosive result of this upward trajectory.', 'But hunting isnâ\x80\x99t the only reason sharks breach. Basking sharks have no need to launch themselves out of the water to catch their prey, but they still engage in breaching. Itâ\x80\x99s possible that they do it as part of their courtship or in an aggressive display by male sharks for dominance. The splash the breach makes may be used as a signal to other sharks either in warning or as a form of communication. Marine pollution, water temperature changes, increased salinity, and the need to rid themselves of parasites may also make sharks jump.', 'The epaulette shark has evolved a survival strategy that larger sharks can only imagine: calmly walking away from trouble.', 'The behavior was first observed in 1995 by researcher Peter Pridmore, but a 2015 BBC program filmed at the Great Barrier Reef drew the worldâ\x80\x99s attention. The epaulette shark lives and hunts on the seafloor around Australia and New Guinea, but as the tide goes out, many find themselves stranded on the reef in temperatures upward of 85Â°F. They have developed the ability to reduce their oxygen intake and to use their pectoral and pelvic fins to walk distances of 100 feet or more. Crawling across the sun-drenched coral, they can find small pools of water that allow them to replenish their oxygen until the sea returns.', 'Since 1995, eight more walking sharks have been identified, including the Halmahera epaulette sharkâ\x80\x94discovered in Indonesia in 2013â\x80\x94and four during a study of the genus Hemiscyllium in 2020. A 2022 study concluded that this ability is becoming even more useful amid climate change, suggesting â\x80\x9cthat this species has adaptations to tolerate some, but perhaps not all, of the challenging conditions predicted for the 21st century.â\x80\x9d', 'Unfortunately, sharks have been found with their stomachs containing all sorts of non-edible objects, including tires, a chicken coop, and even an unexploded bomb. The problem is growing worse as the worldâ\x80\x99s oceans continue to fill with trash.', 'One way that a shark copes is through stomach eversionâ\x80\x94basically, the ability to upchuck their stomachs, wash them out, and then swallow them again, all within a fraction of a second. A 2005 study of a Caribbean reef shark recorded two eversions lasting 0.28 and 0.40 seconds each with a gap of 1.52 seconds between them. The study concluded that â\x80\x9cits function may be related to removal of indigestible food particles and mucus from the inner surface.â\x80\x9d', 'A 1990 study of captive sharks showed that they can also evert their lower intestine through their cloaca, though this cleansing regime seems to last far longer than the stomach variety, with a recent paper in the Journal of Ethology reporting that a shark will swim for over two minutes with its gut hanging from its body (as seen on this recording of a captive tiger shark).Â\xa0', 'Eversion comes with risks in the wild. As part of the Journal of Ethologyâ\x80\x99s study, researchers witnessed an oceanic whitetip shark being chased by smaller predators both â\x80\x9cexploiting ejected digested materialâ\x80\x9d and trying to take bites out of the protruding organ.Â\xa0', 'Sharks can be discovered in nearly every environment on Earth, but one place that few people would expect to find them is in the middle of an active volcano.', 'The Kavachi volcano is located under the Pacific Ocean near the Solomon Islands. It regularly erupts, spewing sulfur, carbon dioxide, ash, and rock out into the water, turning it orange. The caldera is too toxic for humans to enter, and the water is superheatedâ\x80\x94yet two species of shark have made this hostile environment their home. During a non-shark-related study of the volcano in 2015, a robotic submersible discovered hammerhead and silky sharks swimming and hunting in the acidic waters.Â\xa0', 'Scientists are not exactly sure how they survive, but their evolutionary adaptations have allowed them to outlive the â\x80\x9dbig fiveâ\x80\x9d mass extinction events that killed off a staggering number of other species. They have also developed early-warning systems that give them an innate ability to escape the area before an eruption.', 'Surprisingly, the live volcano offers the sharks considerable protection from larger predatorsâ\x80\x94and is a far safer place to exist than in an ocean near humans.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/shark-behavior-facts

But sometimes, itâ\x80\x99s fiction, not reality, that provides the spark of inspiration. There are sci-fi tales, for example, that have gone beyond predicting technological advancements to directly inspiring scientific progress, from robotics to rocketry and everything in between. Here are 11 advancements inspired by works of science fiction to read up on while we wait for teleportation beyond the quantum level.', 'Written under a pen name and published in 1911 by the Stratemeyer Syndicate (which also published the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys novels), Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle sees the titular character invent a weapon that looks like an ordinary rifle but fires bolts of electricity. The book was a childhood favorite of Jack Cover and partly inspired the creation of his own electroshock weapon: The Taser.', 'Cover, an aerospace scientist, began developing the device in the late 1960s in response to the concern that sky marshals firing a gun on a plane would pierce the fuselage or hit critical machinery. He wanted the weapon to be non-lethal (though the end result is more accurately described as â\x80\x9cless-lethalâ\x80\x9d), and inspiration struck when he read about a man who was briefly immobilized after walking into an electric fence. By 1974, Cover had created his own version of Tom Swiftâ\x80\x99s sci-fi weaponâ\x80\x94and as a nod to Swift, he named the device TASER, an acronym of â\x80\x9cThomas A. Swiftâ\x80\x99s Electric Rifle.â\x80\x9d (He added the A to make the word easier to pronounce.)', 'As a young boy, Igor Sikorsky read a Russian translation of Jules Verneâ\x80\x99s 1886 book Robur the Conqueror, also known as The Clipper of the Clouds, and it fired his imagination. Sikorsky not only had Verneâ\x80\x99s description of the helicopter, the Albatross, to stoke the flames of his passion, he also had illustrations by artist Leon Bennett, who worked from Verneâ\x80\x99s own sketches of the flying machine.', 'Sikorsky tested his first helicopter design in 1909 but couldnâ\x80\x99t get it into the air; following another failed attempt in 1910, he switched over to airplanes. Thirty years later, he returned to helicopters, now with decades of aviation experience to pull from. Sikorsky submitted a patent for his helicopter design in 1931, though other experimental helicopters were flown before his was testedâ\x80\x94the first being Louis BrÃ©guetâ\x80\x99s Gyroplane Laboratoire in 1935 [PDF]. These early choppers used multiple main rotors, but it was Sikorskyâ\x80\x99s design of one main rotor on the body and a smaller tail rotor to counteract torque that proved groundbreaking (or, rather, sky-breaking).', 'In 1939, Sikorsky successfully performed a tethered test flight of the VS-300, the prototype of the first practical helicopterâ\x80\x94a momentous flight that lasted mere seconds. (An untethered flight was performed in 1940, after which hundreds more test flights were flown.)

You might be vaguely familiar with the mountains of drift this effect produces, but what really causes it?', 'As you probably guessed, you need a lake to experience lake-effect snow. The primary factor in creating lake-effect snow is a temperature difference between the lake and the air above it. Because water has a high specific heat, it warms and cools much more slowly than the air around it. All summer, the sun heats the lake, which stays warm deep into autumn. When air temperatures dip, we get the necessary temperature difference for lake-effect snow.', 'As the cool air passes over the lake, moisture from the water evaporates and the air directly above the surface heats up. This warm, wet air rises and condenses, quickly forming heavy clouds. The rate of change in temperature as you move up through the air is known as the â\x80\x9clapse rateâ\x80\x9d; the greater the lapse rate, the more unstable a system isâ\x80\x94and the more prone it is to create weather events.', 'Encountering the shore only exacerbates the situation. Increased friction causes the wind to slow down and clouds to â\x80\x9cpile upâ\x80\x9d while hills and variable topography push air up even more dramatically, causing more cooling and more condensation.', 'The other major factors that determine the particulars of a lake-effect snowstorm are the orientation of the wind and the specific lake. Winds blowing along the length of a lake create greater â\x80\x9cfetch,â\x80\x9d the area of water over which the wind blows, and thus more extreme storms. The constraints of the lake itself create stark boundaries between heavy snow and just a few flurries and literal walls of snow that advance onto the shore. The southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes are considered â\x80\x9csnow beltsâ\x80\x9d because, with winds prevailing from the northwest, these areas tend to get hit the hardest.', 'A version of this story ran in 2014; it has been updated for 2022.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60154/what-lake-effect-snow

The best sprouts for the job came at a cost: They were â\x80\x9chorribly bitter,â\x80\x9d he explained, â\x80\x9cand we turned off an entire generation.â\x80\x9d', 'Anti-sprout sentiment began to dissipate in the 1990s, largely because the sprouts themselves became less bitter. As NPR reports, a group of Dutch biotechnologists led by Hans van Doorn pinpointed the chemical compounds behind the sproutâ\x80\x99s characteristic biteâ\x80\x94a couple of glucosinolates called sinigrin and progoitrin.Â\xa0', 'After trawling their stores for old seeds that were low in those potent compounds, Dutch seed suppliers embarked on a years-long mission to breed the ideal plant: one that would turn out not-too-bitter Brussels sprouts, and do so quickly enough to keep up with modern production standards. Their success helped catapult the once-maligned vegetable to culinary stardom, especially in the U.S.', 'Culinary celebrities helped, tooâ\x80\x94like Momofukuâ\x80\x99s David Chang, whose Brussels sprouts with kimchi purÃ©e and bacon inspired other chefs to think outside the box. The 1990s also saw the rise of the Food Network, giving viewers at home a behind-the-scenes look at how to make Brussels sprouts and other polarizing veggies actually taste good.', 'That magic typically involved oven-roasting, which had finally started to supplant boiling as Western cultureâ\x80\x99s de facto method of vegetable preparation. Why it took so long to catch on, as Slateâ\x80\x99s J. Bryan Lowder explained in 2014, was partly due to the long-held belief that ovens were mainly intended for bread and other baked goods (plus the occasional meat), while veggies stayed on the stovetop. Popular cookbooks like Joy of Cooking and The Fannie Farmer Cookbook reinforced this separation by advising boiling, steaming, and sauteing for vegetables.Â\xa0', 'According to Lowder, chefs Johanne Killeen and George Germon led the charge to make oven-roasting a thing pretty much by accident: When they opened their restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1980, it only had an oven. Using it to roast vegetables worked out so well that they simply never stopped, and also ended up recommending the technique in their 1991 cookbook Cucina Simpatica. By 1993, roasting had become such a hit in restaurant kitchens that New York Times food critic Florence Fabricant published a detailed review of its merits for everything from fruits and vegetables to seafood.', 'When seasoned with fish sauce (another Momofuku innovation) or thick Balsamic vinegar and roasted to crispy perfection, even an extra-bitter Brussels sprout is probably preferable to a mild one thatâ\x80\x99s simply been boiled.

238,10 Facts About Wisdom Teeth,"['biology', 'evolution', 'health', 'news', 'science', 'teeth']","['Like puberty and your first heartbreak, the painful process of getting your wisdom teeth removed is one of those cumbersome coming-of-age rituals that many people are forced to endure. But why do we have wisdom teeth when they seem to only cause problems? Read on to find out more about the humble third molarâ\x80\x94the last tooth many of us get as adults.', 'Imagine, for a moment, that youâ\x80\x99re a prehistoric man or woman. You subsist largely on raw meat, roots, and leaves. Youâ\x80\x99d need some pretty powerful chompers to cut up your food, right? That was where your third molarsâ\x80\x94also known as wisdom teethâ\x80\x94came in. Today, our palates are a little more refined, and we prefer softer foods (think avocado toast and smoothies). Plus, modern cooking tools have put our wisdom teeth out of business.', 'Theyâ\x80\x99re not just pointless, thoughâ\x80\x94theyâ\x80\x99re also problematic. Wisdom teeth are a â\x80\x9cscar of human evolution,â\x80\x9d according to Princeton University researcher Alan Mann. About 800,000 to 200,000 years ago, early humansâ\x80\x99 brains started growing at a rapid paceâ\x80\x94so much so that they ballooned to three times their original size. When that happened, it changed the shape of the braincase (the back part of the skull) and its position relative to the dental arcade (rows of teeth). The dental arcade shortened, and suddenly there was no longer enough room for third molars. And since the genes that determine the makeup of our teeth evolve separately from those that control brain development, humans were stuck dealing with the consequences of a crowded mouth, according to Live Science.', 'On the bright side, scientists say evolution may eventually take care of the problem, meaning that people in the future would not develop wisdom teeth. Itâ\x80\x99s anyoneâ\x80\x99s guess as to when this will occur, though. â\x80\x9cOn the evolutionary scale, if I had to predict down the roadâ\x80\x94centuries probablyâ\x80\x94wisdom teeth are going to be one of the things that humans probably wonâ\x80\x99t have anymore,â\x80\x9d Dr. William McCormick, clinical assistant professor at West Virginia Universityâ\x80\x99s School of Dentistry, told Mental Floss in 2018.', 'Itâ\x80\x99s possible that you have one, two, three, four, or none at all. Another possibility, although itâ\x80\x99s rare, is to have more than four wisdom teeth, which are called supernumerary teeth. â\x80\x9cIn my career, I have seen two cases where patients have had fourth molarsâ\x80\x94or two sets of wisdom teeth,â\x80\x9d McCormick said. (Comparatively, humansâ\x80\x99 ancestors had quite the mouthful, with 12 wisdom teeth in total.)', 'According to McCormick, genetic factors like jaw size might determine the number of wisdom teeth that a person has. Your lineage may also have something to do with it. Practically no Indigenous Mexicans have third molars, but almost 100 percent of Aboriginal Tasmanians have at least one wisdom tooth. Americans of African and Asian descent are also more likely than people of European descent to have fewer than four wisdom teeth. This variation can be attributed to a random genetic mutation that arose thousands of years ago, thereby preventing the formation of wisdom teeth. This mutation is more prevalent in certain populations.', 'The roots are the part of the tooth that form first, and then push the bud (the part thatâ\x80\x99s visible in your mouth) through your gums. While wisdom teeth typically have two or three roots, they can have more. McCormick personally removed his wifeâ\x80\x99s wisdom teeth in the â\x80\x9870s and was surprised to see that one of them had five roots. â\x80\x9cIt looked like a spider. It was not a pleasant extraction,â\x80\x9d he said.', 'For that reason, if wisdom teeth need to be removed, itâ\x80\x99s easier to do so before the roots start to take hold. â\x80\x9cWhen the roots are totally formed, theyâ\x80\x99re anchored like a tree thatâ\x80\x99s been in your backyard for 100 years,â\x80\x9d said Dr. Ron Good, an orthodontist in southwestern Pennsylvania who runs a family practice with his brother, Dr. Bob Good. On the other hand, surgeons want some roots to grab hold of, because removing a tiny tooth bud is â\x80\x9clike extracting a marble,â\x80\x9d Dr. Ron told Mental Floss in 2018.', 'According to Guinness World Records, the oldest person to ever grow a wisdom tooth was 94 years old. McCormick said thereâ\x80\x98s a wide variation in ages when eruption occurs; he once had a 65-year-old patient with dentures whose wisdom tooth had started to erupt (poke through the gums). â\x80\x9cTheyâ\x80\x99re crazy little beasts. You never know what youâ\x80\x99re going to see,â\x80\x9d he said.', 'Apparently, wisdom teeth have been acting erratically for thousands of years. Aristotle documented this phenomenon in his book The History of Animals: â\x80\x9cCases have been known in women upwards of 80 years old where at the very close of life the wisdom-teeth have come up, causing great pain in their coming; and cases have been known of the like phenomenon in men too.â\x80\x9d', 'In most cases, though, wisdom teeth erupt when youâ\x80\x99re in your late teens or early twenties.', 'When wisdom teeth donâ\x80\x99t have enough room to grow normally, they get stuck in the jaw and fail to erupt. These are called impacted teeth. The oldest known case of an impacted tooth was found in the skeleton of a 25- to 35-year-old woman who died some 15,000 years ago. This case cast doubt on the theory that impacted teeth are a modern ailment, caused by recent changes in our dietary habits.', 'Many people get their wisdom teeth removed, even if there isnâ\x80\x99t any pain or discernible problem aside from impacting. Known as prophylactic surgery, this preventative practice is common in the U.S., but in recent years there has been some debate as to whether itâ\x80\x99s necessary. One popular theory holds that most people either have problems with their wisdom teeth or will at some point in the future. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s hard to get a percentage, but probably 75 to 80 percent of people do not meet the criteria of being able to successfully maintain their wisdom teeth,â\x80\x9d Dr. Louis K. Rafetto, who headed a task force on wisdom teeth, told The New York Times in 2011.', 'About 3.5 million extraction surgeries are performed each year, and according to another estimate, that adds up to be 10 million individual wisdom teeth pulled annually. Dr. Ron and Dr. Bob, of Good Orthodontics, are both of the opinion that wisdom teeth are ticking time bombs. â\x80\x9cIn our mind, we feel that wisdom teeth, in general, are of no value and are only potential problems,â\x80\x9d Dr. Bob said. He added that third molars can interfere with your bite and cause your teeth to wear down, and in some cases, can also cause cysts, tumors, nerve damage, periodontal disease (affecting the gums and other areas around the teeth), and TMJ disorders (affecting the jaw joint). Plus, if your teeth are too crowded and you arenâ\x80\x99t able to brush and floss them normally, it can lead to additional issues, such as gum disease and cavities.', 'Dental practitioners in the UK put an end to routine wisdom tooth extractions in 1998, citing a study at the University of York that reportedly found no scientific evidence to support the practice [PDF].', ""Opposition is building in the U.S., too. Retired dentist Dr. Jay Friedman told How Stuff Works that only about 12 percent of wisdom teeth eventually cause problems. He compared that rate to the 7 to 14 percent of people who experience appendicitis, yet appendixes arenâ\x80\x99t removed until they become a medical issue. If this seems to contradict Raffeto's statistics, itâ\x80\x99s because there isnâ\x80\x99t a whole lot of concrete data on the subject, and much of it is conflictingâ\x80\x94so it really comes down to the individual physicianâ\x80\x99s and patientâ\x80\x98s preferences. â\x80\x9cAsk three dentists the same question, and youâ\x80\x99re going to get four different answers,â\x80\x9d McCormick said with a laugh."", 'Like Friedman, McCormick doesnâ\x80\x98t support wisdom tooth removal unless thereâ\x80\x99s an infection, abscess, or other problem. â\x80\x9cYou have to weigh the surgical risk with what youâ\x80\x99re going to try to accomplish,â\x80\x9d he said. Like any surgery, wisdom tooth extraction poses a risk, although more serious complications, like fractured jaws and death, are extremely rare. McCormick said some possible side effects include nerve damage, infection, and dry socket (an infection of the tooth socket).', 'Despite the differing opinions in the dental community, McCormick, Dr. Ron, and Dr. Bob agreed that thereâ\x80\x99s no prescriptive rule for wisdom tooth removal, and that each patient should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.', 'In English, the name wisdom tooth conveys the idea that third molars come in later than other teeth, at a time when youâ\x80\x99re older and (hopefully) wiser. Other languages donâ\x80\x99t follow the same convention. In Korean, for example, the poetic name for third molars translates to â\x80\x9clove teeth,â\x80\x9d because itâ\x80\x99s around this time (late teens and early twenties) that one typically experiences their first love. The Japanese language also has a creative word for it: oyashirazu, or â\x80\x9cunknown to parents,â\x80\x9d since most people have already moved away from home by the time their wisdom teeth come in.', 'It turns out wisdom teeth arenâ\x80\x99t all bad. Although some of the research is still in the experimental phase, scientists are studying dental stem cellsâ\x80\x94which were discovered in 2003â\x80\x94to see if they can potentially be used to repair and regenerate tissue.', 'One study on mice, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, found that stem cells taken from wisdom teeth could someday be used to repair corneas that have been scarred by infection or injury. Any clinical applications for humans would require more research, though.', 'â\x80\x9cThere are studies with dental pulp cells being used to treat neurological disorders and problems in the eye and other things,â\x80\x9d Dr. Pamela Robey, of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, told CNN. â\x80\x9cThe problem is, these studies have really not been that rigorous ... the science needs a lot more work.â\x80\x9d', 'A version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2022.', 'Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved']",https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/554979/facts-about-wisdom-teeth

Maybe all of the above.', 'Hornets and yellowjackets are species of wasps common in North America that belong to one taxonomic family, called Vespidae (and bees are another insect entirely). Vespids are known for their caste systems (meaning they live in communities with a queen and workers), and all have wings that are able to fold in half.', 'Here are 10 fascinating facts about wasps in the Vespidae familyâ\x80\x94and a few notable othersâ\x80\x94that prove theyâ\x80\x99re more than just stinging insects.Â\xa0', 'You may think that all wasps are make beelines towards humans, but this couldnâ\x80\x99t be further from the truth. Wasps are divided into two categories: social wasps and solitary wasps. Social wasps are further classified into three groupsâ\x80\x94hornets, yellowjackets, and paper waspsâ\x80\x94and live in colonies in communal nests. Theyâ\x80\x99re carnivorous and more aggressive towards humans, which can result in stings. Solitary wasps, on the other hand, often live in individual nests in the ground and arenâ\x80\x99t dangerous to humans unless provoked. In fact, theyâ\x80\x99re valuable pollinators and feed on smaller insects and spiders, depending on their species.Â\xa0', 'While wasps live in all of the worldâ\x80\x99s temperate regions, there has been at least one case of unusual transcontinental migration in recent years. Nests of the Asian giant hornet, native to East and South Asia, were found in the Pacific Northwest of North America in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021, creating concern that the bee-eating species will become invasive in that region. USDA pest response guidelines suggest that the giant hornet may have arrived in the U.S. in a shipment of goods from Asia [PDF].', 'Yellowjackets are one of the most familiar and aggressive wasps in American backyards. They often nest in the ground and defend their turf at all costs. â\x80\x9cWhen a yellowjacket stings, it tags the victim with an alarm pheromone that may last for hours,â\x80\x9d writes Alabama Cooperative Extension Service specialist Xing Ping Hu. The chemical tag marks the victim as a threat and makes him or her a potential target for other yellowjackets. Unfortunately, pretty much anything can make yellowjackets mad, such as walking near their nests or mowing the lawn over their colonies.', 'While this habit varies by species, itâ\x80\x99s common for social wasps to feed their offspring a diet of live insects [PDF], which can include pests that harm cultivated plants. Yellowjackets are an exceptionâ\x80\x94they scavenge dead insects, worms, and garbage.', 'Species in the subfamily of wasps known as paper wasps chew up bits of wood and bark, mixing it with their saliva, and spit out a rough papery pulp. They form the substance into nests, which can contain individual cells facing downward or resemble a gray football. Paper wasp nests are often located on trees, in vegetation, or under the eaves of homes.Â\xa0', 'Many wasps fend off predators with distinctive yellow and black bands on their abdomens, but this isnâ\x80\x99t true of all species. Wasps sport a variety of colors, including red, blue, green, and orange. The steel blue cricket hunter, for instance, is a blue solitary wasp, while the cicada killer wasp is orange. Bright colors are meant to serve as a warning to other species, while darker colors help the insects blend in with their surroundings.', 'Polybia paulista, a species of wasp found in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, produces a compound called Polybia-MP1 that has been heavily studied for its anti-cancer, antifungal, and antibiotic properties. The chemical can attack cancer cells in humans without damaging healthy cells, raising hopes that it could provide new therapeutic options for treating disease.', 'Fairy flies, a.k.a. fairy wasps, are a family of about 1400 wasp species native to tropical climates. They grow up to 1 millimeter in length, making them the worldâ\x80\x99s smallest insects known to science.
